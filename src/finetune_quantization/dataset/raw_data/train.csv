"<document> Russia is considering bailing out Greece in exchange for the country’s ‘assets’, it was reported last night. Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas in a bid to lessen its dependence on the West . The visit will raise fears the radical left government is looking east in search of alternative sources of finance as it bids to avoid bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin (pictured earlier this week) in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas . Ahead of his visit, Mr Tsipras condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. But Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, has already warned it would be ‘unacceptable’ if Mr Tsipras ‘jeopardised Europe’s common policy on Russia’ in return for Kremlin aid. Kommersant newspaper quoted an anonymous Russian government source last night saying that lines of credit were being offered. ‘We’re ready to consider the question of providing Greece discounts on gas: the price for it is tied to the cost of oil which has significantly fallen in recent months,’ the source said. ‘We are also ready to discuss the possibility of granting Greece new loans. But here we, in turn, are interested in reciprocal moves – in particular, in Russia receiving particular assets in Greece.’ Yesterday Greece demanded more than £200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or £204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. Greece’s defence minister said it had obtained ‘stunning evidence’ to support its massive claims for reparations. Panos Kammenos said the country had obtained records held by the US military that review the extent of damage to private and public property during the Nazi occupation. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Mr Tsipras (pictured) condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt in a matter of days . The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler’s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Mr Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany’s GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a ‘moral and ethical’ issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. ‘According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,’ he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece’s debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece’s state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation – a fraction of the Greek demand. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the issue of compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month (pictured) Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. ‘After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,’ Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country’s bankruptcy by ‘loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer’. </document> <Summary> Russia is considering bailing out Greece in exchange for the country’s ‘assets’.

"<document> Speaker 7: And, you know, when we start talking about equity, not, you know, targeting the same neighborhoods over and over. So these are some things that I want to make sure that we as a council are being brought into that conversation and not be expected to just rubber stamp something at the 11th hour.
Speaker 7: Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 2: And I believe we are coming back to the safety committee at some point in July for an update. So we're working to schedule.
Speaker 7: Great. Thank you so.
Speaker 0: Much. Thank you. Hold on. Just take somebody else. Councilmember Kenny.
Speaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Just a comment. I really appreciate Councilwoman CdeBaca highlighting the need to maintain and sustain the level of service we're providing. We may actually even need to prepare to expand it if people fall into homelessness because of the economic crisis we're facing.
Speaker 6: So even while we successfully house people, we may have more people coming into homelessness. It does not mean that our solution of supportive housing doesn't work. It simply means it's not to scale, to keep pace with the need, particularly in an economic crisis.
Speaker 6: But I do just want to say that for for those who may be watching or listening, who are passionate about maintaining the level of care and emergency shelter that we've been providing, it is critical that you check into the group living zoning process.
Speaker 6: I know I may begin to sound like a broken record, but our zoning code has codified some of the same racism and exclusion that we are talking about in other systems in our city. And there is a proposal that would expand the ability and modernize the ability to provide shelter so that we can not only maintain but
Speaker 6: improve the quality of shelter to provide, for example, 24, seven services versus just overnight sleeping on a mat. Our zoning code right now actually codifies the fact that people can't be in beds in some cases because a shelter might lose its, quote unquote, emergency overflow status.
Speaker 6: Those are some of the back flips our current zoning code requires of providers. So I just want to say that if these issues are important, it is about money. It's about our budget conversation, it's about the safety conversation, but it's also about zoning.
Speaker 6: If our neighborhoods do not include and welcome people of various backgrounds to live in our city, then we will not be able to achieve the goal of making sure that when this shelter closes, people don't end up on the streets.
Speaker 6: So I just wanted to connect issues again that are connected. You can go to Denver Gov Dawgs Group Living to learn more about that change. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. All right, that concludes the comments on this item. Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens and that will be Bill 508. Councilmember CdeBaca, go ahead with your questions on. You're right.

"<document> Charles Tillman has concluded his storied 12-year career with the Chicago Bears. The veteran cornerback has agreed a deal with the Carolina Panthers with the two-time Pro Bowler opting to link-up with Ron Rivera. At the age of 34 and after another injury-hit season, the new Bears hierarchy did not express an interest in keeping Tillman on the roster. But he leaves Chicago with his achievements on the field matched by those off it. Charles Tillman has ended his Chicago career but remains a favourite for  his work on and off the field . Drafted in the second round from Louisiana Lafeyette in 2003, Tillman became a staple of Lovie Smith's stingy defense, which propelled the Bears to Super Bowl XLI. A franchise record holder for defensive touchdowns and interception returns for touchdowns, the forced fumble specialist lies third on the all-time list for interceptions with 36. He started 152 of 156 games, but finished the past two seasons on injured reserve after tearing his right triceps. Tillman said the chance to work with Rivera - a former Bears player who worked as defensive co-ordinator from 2004-6 - was too good to turn down. Tillman holds several Bears defensive accolades and was a stalwart of their defense during his 12 years . 'I think Coach Rivera was one of the main reasons why I wanted to be here,' Tillman said. 'He's a guy that I had a lot of respect for when I was in Chicago. I love his leadership and his qualities as a coach, and he's done a good job with the Panthers. There's a good group of guys here like Thomas Davis, Greg Olsen, Luke Kuechly and Cam Newton. I got a good vibe here.' 'This is a similar defense, and Steve Wilks and (defensive line coach) Eric Washington were also in Chicago, so there is familiarity.' Since setting up the Cornerstone Foundation a decade ago, Tillman's charity has impacted over a million needy children and their families in the Chicago area. His work with the foundation was honoured with the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in 2014. In a quirk of fate, the Panthers also have the 2015 recipient of the award, Thomas Davis, on their roster. </document> <Summary> Charles Tillman has concluded his storied 12-year career with the Chicago Bears and has agreed a deal with the Carolina Panthers.

"<document> Slavery and Social Death was widely reviewed and lavishly praised for its erudition and conceptual rigor. As a result of its success, social death has become a handy general definition of slavery, for many historians and non-historians alike. But it is often forgotten that the concept of social death is a distillation from Patterson’s breathtaking survey—a theoretical abstraction that is meant not to describe the lived experiences of the enslaved so much as to reduce them to a least common denominator that could reveal the essence of slavery in an ideal-type slave, shorn of meaningful heritage.6 As a concept, it is what Frederick Cooper has called an “agentless abstraction” that provides a neat cultural logic but ultimately does little to illuminate the social and political experience of enslavement and the struggles that produce historic transformations.7 Indeed, it is difficult to use such a distillation to explain the actual behavior of slaves, and yet in much of the scholarship that followed in the wake of Slavery and Social Death, Patterson’s abstract distillates have been used to explain the existential condition of the enslaved. Having emerged from the discipline of sociology, “social death” fit comfortably within a scholarly tradition that had generally been more alert to deviations in patterns of black life from prevailing social norms than to the worldviews, strategies, and social tactics of people in black communities. Together with Patterson’s work on the distortions wrought by slavery on black families, “social death” reflected sociology’s abiding concern with “social pathology”; the “pathological condition” of twentieth-century black life could be seen as an outcome of the damage that black people had suffered during slavery. University of Chicago professor Robert Park, the grand-pe`re of the social pathologists, set the terms in 1919: “the Negro, when he landed in the United States, left behind almost everything but his dark complexion and his tropical temperament.”8 Patterson’s distillation also conformed to the nomothetic imperative of social science, which has traditionally aimed to discover universal laws of operation that would be true regardless of time and place, making the synchronic study of social phenomena more tempting than more descriptive studies of historical transformation. Slavery and Social Death took shape during a period when largely synchronic studies of antebellum slavery in the United States dominated the scholarship on human bondage, and Patterson’s expansive view was meant to situate U.S. slavery in a broad context rather than to discuss changes as the institution developed through time. Thus one might see “social death” as an obsolete product of its time and tradition, an academic artifact with limited purchase for contemporary scholarship, were it not for the concept’s reemergence in some important new studies of slavery.9 WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED AS AMONG the most onerous of social institutions, slavery has much to tell us about the way human beings react to oppression. At the same time, the extreme nature of the institution naturally encourages a pessimistic view of the capacity for collective agency among subjugated people. As a result, trends in the study of slavery, as with the study of dominance more generally, often divide between works that emphasize the overwhelming power of the institution and scholarship that focuses on the resistant efforts of the enslaved. In turn, this division frames a problem in the general understanding of political life, especially for the descendants of the powerless. It might even be said that these kinds of studies form different and opposing genres—hopeful stories of heroic subalterns versus anatomies of doom—that compete for ascendance. In recent years, if the invocation of Patterson’s “social death” is any indication, the pendulum seems to have swung decidedly toward despair. </document> <Summary> Slavery and Social Death was widely reviewed and praised for its erudition and conceptual rigor, leading to the widespread adoption of social death as a general definition of slavery by many historians and non-historians alike.
However, it is important to remember that social death is a theoretical abstraction distilled from Patterson's survey, not meant to fully capture the lived experiences of the enslaved but rather reduce them to a simplistic common denominator, devoid of meaningful heritage.
Frederick Cooper's term agentless abstraction aptly describes social death, providing a neat cultural logic but falling short in illuminating the true social and political experiences of enslavement and the transformative struggles faced by the enslaved.
Scholars have used Patterson's abstract distillates to explain the existential condition of the enslaved, despite its limitations in accurately describing their actual behavior.
Social death emerged from sociology, aligning with a tradition focused on deviations in black life from prevailing social norms rather than understanding the worldviews, strategies, and social tactics of black communities. </Summary>"

"<document> It is undoubtedly within the power of the Federal Government to exclude aliens from the country. Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U. S. 581, 603-604. It is also without doubt that this power can be effectuated by routine inspections and searches of individuals or conveyances seeking to cross our borders. As the Court stated in Carroll v. United States: ""Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in."" 267 U. S., at 154. See also Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.¶ Whatever the permissible scope of intrusiveness of a routine border search might be, searches of this kind may in certain circumstances take place not only at the border itself, but at its functional equivalents as well. For 273*273 example, searches at an established station near the border, at a point marking the confluence of two or more roads that extend from the border, might be functional equivalents of border searches. For another example, a search of the passengers and cargo of an airplane arriving at a St. Louis airport after a nonstop flight from Mexico City would clearly be the functional equivalent of a border search.[4]¶ But the search of the petitioner's automobile by a roving patrol, on a California road that lies at all points at least 20 miles north of the Mexican border,[5] was of a wholly different sort. In the absence of probable cause or consent, that search violated the petitioner's Fourth Amendment right to be free of ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""¶ It is not enough to argue, as does the Government, that the problem of deterring unlawful entry by aliens across long expanses of national boundaries is a serious one. The needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension with the Constitution's protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power. It is precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards. It 274*274 is well to recall the words of Mr. Justice Jackson, soon after his return from the Nuremberg Trials:¶ ""These [Fourth Amendment rights], I protest, are not mere second-class rights but belong in the catalog of indispensable freedoms. Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government."" Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 180 (Jackson, J., dissenting).¶ The Court that decided Carroll v. United States, supra, sat during a period in our history when the Nation was confronted with a law enforcement problem of no small magnitude—the enforcement of the Prohibition laws. But that Court resisted the pressure of official expedience against the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Chief Justice Taft's opinion for the Court distinguished between searches at the border and in the interior, and clearly controls the case at bar:¶ ""It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is 275*275 known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise."" 267 U.

"<document> The U.S. House passed a $12.3 billion water-projects bill that lawmakers said would boost dredging to accommodate larger ships built to transit the expanding Panama Canal. The measure, passed 412-4, would be the first water infrastructure bill enacted since 2007. It would authorize 34 projects including dredging, flood control, hurricane recovery and environmental restoration. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act, H.R. 3080, would revamp the way major U.S. shipping projects are funded. The bill would allow ports to pay the cost of deepening harbors up front and then seek reimbursement from the government once a project is authorized by lawmakers. That could help facilities such as Port Everglades in South Florida reduce construction time by years. “It is a jobs bill,” House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster told reporters. In addition to construction jobs, the Pennsylvania Republican said, “when America invests in its infrastructure and keeps us competitive, that means our industry and business can be competitive and add jobs on the factory floor.” The measure would expand the number of U.S. ports that can handle super freighters built by Maersk Inc. and Mediterranean Shipping Co. to take advantage of the expanding Panama Canal. Expanded capacity would reduce shipping costs for exporters including Caterpillar Inc. and Cargill Inc. ‘No’ Votes All four House lawmakers voting against the measure were Republicans: Justin Amash of Michigan, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and Matt Salmon of Arizona. The bill was the subject of a lobbying campaign that industry groups said they want to make a model for future infrastructure bills. Shipping industry groups targeted Tea Party lawmakers by stressing the role of interstate commerce in the Constitution, and emphasizing quotes from founding fathers such as George Washington backing the construction of canals. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has said the Senate will act on the compromise bill this week. By far the biggest spending project authorized in the measure is $6.7 billion for a Louisiana levee system called Morganza to the Gulf. Other flood-prevention projects in the bill are a diversion channel for the Red River of the North near Fargo, North Dakota, and Moorhead, Minnesota, as well as levees in the Natomas Basin in Sacramento, California. The largest navigation project would deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which connects the oil-refining hub of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, with the Gulf of Mexico. Keystone Pipeline The Port Arthur area is home to the southern end of the Keystone XL pipeline. Deepening the port would reduce shipping costs for oil and natural gas processed there by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Total SA and Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) Paul Beard, chairman of the Sabine Neches Navigation District, said he was “thrilled” by the project’s inclusion. The navigation district, which oversees the waterway on the Texas-Louisiana border, projects the channel deepening to boost business activity by $5 billion. The measure also would speed environmental reviews of infrastructure plans, capping review time at three years. Farm Bureau The American Farm Bureau Federation urged Congress to pass the bill. Farmers “depend on an efficient and reliable inland waterway system linked to competitive ports,” bureau President Bob Stallman said in a statement today. Environmental groups objected to the limit on review time, and the measure drew opposition from small-government groups including Heritage Action. “It hikes spending while doing little to reduce bureaucracy and limit the role of the federal government,” Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said in an e-mail urging lawmakers to vote against the bill. Shuster and House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said the measure was a success for those who want to trim government. The bill was crafted without earmarks to fund pet projects in lawmakers’ home states, they said. It also would delete $18 billion in backlogged projects that, while unlikely to get built, were still technically on government ledgers. It also would create a Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Authority, a federal-private financing program for water infrastructure. About $175 million in subsidies through 2019 may lead to $1.75 billion in projects, Bloomberg Industries analyst Brian Friel said. Project Financing JPMorgan Chase & Co. led U.S. project financing for the year to date, underwriting $89 billion in projects through May 20, according to a Bloomberg compilation of data. JPMorgan was followed by Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. The measure would encourage the use of U.S.-made iron and steel products that could increase demand for products manufactured by Nucor Corp. and United States Steel Corp., Bloomberg analysts Friel and Brad Barker said. </document> <Summary> The U.S. House passed a $12.3 billion water-projects bill that lawmakers said would boost dredging to accommodate larger ships built to transit the expanding Panama Canal.

"<document> While the 3pm slump has most of us reaching for a chocolate bar, the sugar crash that comes afterwards, and the guilt, can ruin the enjoyment. But chocoholics can now get their fix guilt-free, as a raw foodie has developed healthy spins on all the classic chocolate bars. Taline Gabrielian, 33, of Sydney's Northern Beaches has recreated the entire range of chocolate bar favourites, including Mars Bars, Snickers, Bounty, Twix and Cherry Ripe, and published the recipes through her best-selling food app, Hippie Lane. Scroll down for the recipe . Mars mania: Fans of the Mars Bar can now enjoy the guilt-free version, with raw recipes by Taline Gabrielian . Choc-full of goodness: No need to count calories or sneaky this Mars Bar, it's sugar-free, vegan and dairy-free . With 129,000 Instagram followers and the Hippie Lane app consistently sitting in the top three of 'most popular food and drink' apps on iTunes since its release in January, Gabrielian attributes all her  success to the re-imagining of sweet tooth favourites. 'It was definitely my tactic. I thought the best way to grow the business and inspire a healthy lifestyle was to offer people something they understand, that looks and tastes like the real deal,' the mother of two told Daily Mail Australia. Gabrielian, who began stocking raw treats in local cafes and photographing them, only realised the serious demand for her sweet treats when she reached 80,000 followers within a year. Healthy hippy: Taline Gabrielian said her choc bars satisfy her, even though she grew up on Nutella and Milo . Twix treats: 'I always crave something after dinner, so these Twix bars still give me the same satisfaction' 'They just loved  that I was portraying healthy versions of the chocolates they knew and loved. They were commenting saying ""does it really taste like a Mars Bar?,"" and basically just wanted a piece of the pie,' she said. While her app has 50 recipes in total, the classic top five favourite bars are by far her most popular, according to Gabriel. But she says her mint slice, caramel and choc cheesecake are also go down a treat too. While the chocolates are all classified as raw, vegan, refined sugar-free and dairy-free, Gabriel assured DMA that this in no way means 'fun or taste-free', people are sold by her recipes. Cherry on top: Gabriel recreated the classic cherry ripe bar for those who like a fruity take on chocolate . 'I began competitions early on (on her Instagram) to remake my treats and convince them it's the real deal and the recipes work. And they loved them, saying 'this is the best peppermint slice I've ever tried and knocking on my door wanting more.' Gabriel shares her top substitutes to eat healthy sweet treats... 1. Swap sugar for... rice malt syrup . 'It's derived from brown rice and is milled down until it becomes syrup.' 2. Swap caramel for... nut butters . 'I will mix almond butter with tahini, coconut oil and dates.' 3. Swap flour for... nut meal . 'When making a biscuit base I like to use a mix of walnuts and almond meal' 4. Swap chocolate for... cacao powder . 'I make chocolate by mixing cacao powder, coconut oil and maple syrup.' 5. Swap butter for... coconut oil . As a self-proclaimed chocoholic who grew up on a diet of Milo and Nutella, Gabriel knows what those with a sweet tooth expect, but ever since she converted to healthy versions, she's never looked back. 'I always crave something after lunch or dinner, I get a sugar rush - we all need it. But I still get the same feeling having one of my Twix bars.' 'Once  in blue moon I will try a  normal chocolate bar again and it’s sickly sweet. But once you cut all the bad sweets and find healthy replacements there's no reason to go back.' For Gabriel, her main criterion for all her chocolate bars are that they are beautiful tasting, using simple ingredients,easy to make, familiar to her followers and have a 'feel good' taste factor. New to the raw baking scene? Rest assured, Gabriel said all her recipes are easy - all it requires is stocking up on a pantry of new ingredients. While she admits some of the recommended  swaps like coconut oil, rice malt syrup and cacao can be expensive to begin with, once you have them, they will be on high rotation - so you get your money's worth.

"<document> Focus on Chinese Anti-Surface Warfare¶ This brief focuses on one area in which China has made rapid and substantial relative improvements: its ability to locate and attack U.S. surface ships, especially aircraft carriers, in conflicts centered on Taiwan or the Spratly Islands.¶ During the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996, China was reportedly unable to locate, much less attack, two U.S. aircraft-carrier battle groups in the waters around Taiwan. In contrast, China can now hold the U.S. Navy's surface fleet at risk at significant ranges from the mainland. This threat to the U.S. surface fleet continues to grow. China's anti-surface capability is founded on four developments: (1) the establishment of an increasingly capable long-range maritime surveillance capability designed to detect and track surface ships, (2) the deployment of sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and the world's first anti-ship ballistic missile, (3) the acquisition of strike aircraft with greater range and power, and (4) the deployment of new classes of larger and quieter submarines armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes.¶   While the development of China's anti-ship ballistic missile capability has garnered headlines, this analysis suggests that the PLA's steady (but less heralded) development of quieter, more capable submarines represents a more immediate threat — one that puts U.S. carrier-strike groups within 2,000 km of the Chinese coast at significant risk. In 1996, China had taken delivery of only two submarines that could be described, by any reasonable definition, as modern. The remainder of its fleet consisted of legacy boats based on 1950s technology, lacking teardrop shaped hulls and armed only with torpedoes. By 2017, China will have a smaller but more capable fleet, with 49 modern ships, including both Russian Kilo-class boats and indigenous designs. China's recent submarine classes are armed with both sophisticated cruise missiles and torpedoes, greatly increasing the range from which they can attack. Although most Chinese boats are diesel-powered and none is not up to U.S. standards, they could nevertheless threaten U.S. surface ships.¶ Assessing the Submarine Threat in the Taiwan and Spratly Islands Scenarios¶ The researchers assessed various aspects of Chinese intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and the anti-surface warfare battle. This discussion is limited to the modeling of Chinese submarine attacks against U.S. carriers in two scenarios at varying distances from the mainland: a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and a campaign to occupy a portion of the Spratly Islands. Inputs included sensor ranges, weapon capabilities, the movement speed of Chinese submarines and U.S. warships, and the ability of U.S. anti-submarine warfare assets (including submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and helicopters) to screen the fleet and to detect and suppress or destroy Chinese submarines.¶ The primary output metric was ""attack opportunities"" — the number of times Chinese submarines could reach positions to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier over a seven-day period. In assessing each scenario, the team considered cases in which each submarine acted individually with no external sources of information about the location of U.S. carriers and cases in which the submarines received cueing about the target location once every 24 hours. The results are not intended to represent fully developed or precise predictions. But given the consistency of the methodology applied over the period considered, they provide a good indicator of trends over time, as well as an idea of the general scale of the challenge at any given point in time.¶ As shown in the figure, under all scenarios and circumstances considered, Chinese capabilities to generate submarine-attack opportunities increased by more than an order of magnitude between 1996 and 2010 — and further increases are likely through 2017. This improvement came despite a reduction in the overall size of China's submarine force and improvements to U.S. anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The quieting of Chinese submarines and the addition of cruise missiles largely accounts for the change.¶ A second notable pattern is that even occasional cueing from other ISR assets regarding the location of U.S. carrier-strike groups would increase the ability of Chinese submarines to engage U.S. aircraft carriers by nearly an order of magnitude above that without cueing. While it is not possible to confidently assess how often cueing might be provided in an actual conflict, improvements to Chinese ISR have improved the chances that Chinese submarines will receive such information. Chinese submarine commanders may not execute an attack every time they have an opportunity to engage, and each attack may not result in a ""hit,"" much less the disabling or destruction of a carrier. However, the modeling indicates that the risks to U.S. carriers are substantial and rising.¶ U.S. Mitigation Options¶ The U.S. military has a variety of means to mitigate specific threats, and it will improve them over time. New counterspace and cyber capabilities may enable U.S. forces to degrade China's space-based ISR, as well as its over-the-horizon radar. The U.S. Navy is almost certainly working on technical counters to China's budding anti-ship ballistic-missile threat, both through kinetic ballistic-missile defenses and, perhaps more importantly, ways to defeat Chinese weapons sensors. Aircraft carriers can provide their own defensive combat air patrols to defeat the threat from enemy aircraft, and the United States is acquiring more and better anti-submarine warfare assets.¶ Nevertheless, given growing threats from China's submarines, as well as China's increasingly capable strike aircraft and anti-ship missiles, U.S. carriers may be held farther from the Chinese coast, particularly during the early stages of a conflict. This will reduce the number of U.S. naval aircraft in the fight, as these aircraft will have to traverse greater distances and will therefore spend less time on station. It will also increase the demand for U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft to refuel them. Increased tanker demand will, in turn, place further stress on available U.S. basing, which may itself be under threat from ballistic and cruise missile attack. </document> <Summary> its ability to locate and attack U.S. surface ships, especially aircraft carriers, in conflicts centered on Taiwan or the Spratly Islands.

"<document> Former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden on Monday marveled at the puny nature of the surveillance reforms put in place two years after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed a vast expansion of intrusive U.S. government surveillance at home and abroad.¶ Hayden mocked the loss of the one program that was reined in — the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata information about domestic phone calls — calling it “that little 215 program.”¶ And he said if someone had told him two years ago that the only effect of the Snowden revelations would be losing it, his reaction would have been: “Cool!”¶ Here is the video and the full text of his remarks:¶ If somebody would come up to me and say “Look, Hayden, here’s the thing: This Snowden thing is going to be a nightmare for you guys for about two years.

Cool!”¶ Hayden was speaking at the annual meeting of the Wall Street Journal CFO Network, an event hosted “by the Journal’s senior editors” for “an invitation-only group of more than 100 chief financial officers of the world’s largest companies.”¶ Asked if he thought Snowden was a foreign agent, Hayden said: “I’ve got my suspicions,” although he acknowledged, “I’ve got no evidence.”¶ Some opponents of massive government surveillance hailed the passage, earlier this month, of the USA Freedom Act. And it did, in fact, mark the first time that Congress has limited the executive branch’s surveillance authority over four decades of explosive growth.¶ But some observers noted that it was a very small step at best. The program was just one out of the multitude Snowden revealed — and was so blatantly out of line that its end was virtually a foregone conclusion as soon as it was exposed.¶ Seemingly irreconcilable media coverage reflected the reality that the reform bill was both important and, from the NSA’s perspective, trivial.¶ Hayden’s remarks were the most blunt yet emphasizing that latter point. </document> <Summary> Former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden on Monday marveled at the puny nature of the surveillance reforms put in place two years after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed a vast expansion of intrusive U.S. government surveillance at home and abroad.¶

Neighbours say ambulances arrived at this property at 1am. After arriving at hospital Miss Swinfield was put into a coma, but died a week later . Police are still waiting for the result of the post-mortem but it is believed the teenager had taken the illegal Class B drug Mephedrone - more commonly known as MCat or Meow Meow. Miss Swinfield's mother Kay, 39, said: 'I'm devastated. It happened at [her friend] Lauren's house. 'Abby hadn't seen Lauren in three years but she kept contacting her and saying ""come to mine for a party. We got a phone call that night saying she was at the hospital. 'Doctors told me she died of multiple organ failure after suffering two heart attacks. 'They said she'd been lying in the same position for a long time because she had a big blister on her back.' Abby's cousin Lydia Moore, 18, added: 'We don't think she took it on her own accord. We think her drink was spiked. 'Abby was a perfect girl who would be there for you if you needed it. She had an amazing heart. She had so many friends. Miss Swinfield's mother, Kay, said she is 'devastated' over her daughter's death, saying she suffered two heart attacks before dying of multiple organ failure after taking the drug . Miss Swinfield has a son, who is believed to be three years old. Her cousin Lydia Moore, 18, said the youngster keeps asking for his mother . 'She had a beautiful son and she loved him. What's heartbreaking is her son keeps asking for his mom. Someone has taken his mom from him. The family has been torn apart.' Police have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying Class B drugs, and she has been released on bail. Staffordshire police said they have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying drugs, amid allegations Miss Swinfield's drink was spiked . Linus Pebliauskas, 29, who lives on Bridgwater Street, where the party was held, said: 'I didn't know who lived at the house but there were many young lads going in and out of there. 'There was drinking throughout the day and not just at weekends. It was a bit of a party house from what I could tell.' Yesterday a friend who was at the party, but did not want to be named, added: 'We are in absolute shock. 'There was a house party and there were loads of people there, I don't know how she got the drugs. 'She had a three-year-old boy, it is so tragic. 'Her mum Kay is absolutely distraught. She is really angry about what happened and the fact there were drugs at this party. 'She had come down to visit friends and have a good night out and now she is dead, I cannot believe it. 'She was a very popular girl and we are just completely numb at the moment. I can't get my head around it.' A spokeswoman for Staffordshire Police added: 'She has been released on police bail pending further investigation until a date in June. 'A post-mortem examination will take place in the coming days to help establish the cause of death. 'Anyone with information on the incident is urged to call Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident 790 of March 30.' Police had previously warned about the use of M-Cat in Tamworth after a raid two months ago during which 4lbs of the drug, worth thousands of pounds, was discovered. </document> <Summary> Abby Swinfield, an 18-year-old mother-of-one from Castle Donington, Derbyshire, died from multiple organ failure after taking M-Cat at a house party.
Rushed to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, after a party, she slipped into a coma and passed away a week later.
Police arrested a girl for drug supply, and Abby's cousin suggested her drink was spiked.
Despite suffering two heart attacks, Abby's death was attributed to organ failure.
Her devastated family mourned her loss, especially her young son, who now asks for his mother.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have previously warned about M-Cat use in the area. </Summary>"

#Person1#: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.

"<document> The ports of Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore have completed projects that put them in position to be the first to receive the big ships, some of them 1,110 feet long with the capacity to haul up to 13,000 boxcar-size freight containers, Ellis said. Elsewhere, the work is in varying stages: The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to finish dredging a 50-foot deep channel to three terminals in New York Harbor by the end of the year and to the main New York terminal by 2014, according to New York/New Jersey Port Authority spokesman Hunter Pendarvis. The authority has committed $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge by 64 feet to allow the bigger ships to pass under, he said. Miami-Dade County reached an agreement in April with environmental groups that had raised concerns about the Port of Miami's Deep Dredge project. It is expected to be able to handle the big ships by 2014 or soon thereafter, according to Ellis. The Corps of Engineers completed a study in April finding that Savannah, Ga.'s proposed $652-million channel deepening project is viable. The Corps is in the midst of a study of Charleston harbor, said Jim Newsome, president and CEO of the South Carolina Ports Authority. Philadelphia and Corpus Christi are currently involved in dredging projects, according to Ellis. Boston, Jacksonville, Canaveral and Freeport, Texas, are among other ports pursuing deeper channels, he said. </document> <Summary> The ports of Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore have completed projects that put them in position to be the first to receive the big ships, some of them 1,110 feet long with the capacity to haul up to 13,000 boxcar-size freight containers, Ellis said.

Speaker 7: I just want to say something about the library. So. Oh, sure. So quickly. So we had some challenges with Fire Station 12 and its construction. It's particularly important that we have construction management on this library. I think folks should know that we've you know, we've taken our time to select a construction manager to ensure that we we
Speaker 7: do the right thing and we don't have to run into the problems we ran into with Fire Station 12. The date for the for the fire station for the library groundbreaking will be will be within this next month.

Speaker 1: Oh, great. There's been a motion. Any public comment on this item? Mr. Goodhew. Very good. Your clinic has addressed, obviously, supporters of finance for libraries. My mother was a librarian, actually went earned her degree about a decade and a half earlier or before.
Speaker 1: Eleanor Schmidt, who was our librarian for almost two and a half decades here. Also my great great uncle who I never met but designed our is main library. I fully support this. I'm hoping you can find some money at some point in time and I'm going to recommend that you buy that they.
Speaker 1: One of the first books they buy there and then have an average library. This book called The Boys in the Boat. In fact, I've recommended to Mr. Steinhauser that it be required reading it put on the required reading list or social studies in the Long Beach Unified School District.
Speaker 1: It is a fantastic book about what it is. It's a story about the 1936 Olympic eight, the gold medal boat. But it is much more than that. It is a fantastic recount of what life was like in the Depression area era up in Washington and across the country.
Speaker 1: It's got you can Google of sight and you can see it. You can actually see a two and a half minute video of the final race in Berlin. But again, it's called Boys in the Boat. I think every single council person should read it.
Speaker 1: I think, as I say, I think it will be read in the schools. I know every athletic coach, regardless of the sport, will read it. But it's just a fantastic, well-written it's well-written account of the struggles of the average American family back in the Depression and the economic hard times they face, which will probably resonate with a
Speaker 1: lot of people today. And so they get a good perspective of what life was back in the United States, although it does center in the northwestern part of this country again. Boys in the boat. Google it. You can read the reviews and you can even see the the video of black and white, the final race in Berlin

Speaker 4: To you.
Speaker 0: You called out.
Speaker 4: It's the special revenue.
Speaker 0: So this is part of our.
Speaker 5: This is our.
Speaker 4: Furlough.
Speaker 0: No, this is not. This is part of your budget. Anything you didn't spend last year, if we don't vote on this, it goes into the general fund. This puts it back in your office budget for this year.
Speaker 4: Okay. And so does this have any connection to the dollars that we were supposed to sequester? Will we have to sequester this once we get it back?
Speaker 0: No, this is moving in. Councilmember Gilmore has our budget and she's flagging me as I'm going to. We'll let her answer that in case.
Speaker 7: Thank you, President Clark. Councilwoman CdeBaca, this transfer is a portion of the special revenue fund that was allocated for the 4% sequester from the central office. And then it's a portion of Councilwoman Torres, my office, Councilwoman Sandoval's office.
Speaker 7: The 4% that city council was sequestering was $7,979. And so this is a portion of some of those offices using their special revenue fund to use that for the 4% sequester. So like your office isn't included in this because I believe your office well, you aren't participating, but so the other offices there may be taking that 4%
Speaker 7: out of their services and supplies. And so we won't see that come forward.
Speaker 4: Awesome. Thank you very much. I wanted to clarify that because as you all are looking at your budgets, take a look at what city council budget is for us to operate 13 offices. There's a reason why some of you don't get callbacks or responses on email, and it's because our executive branch of government keeps our branch of
Speaker 4: government. That's supposed to be the check and balance starved so that we can't respond, so that we can't do these things. And so we were asked by the administration, even though we're not required to furlough, we were asked to furlough and to set aside budget cuts.
Speaker 4: And this is part of what some of those offices had decided to give or not give up. I chose not to because our office receives the highest volume of everything that happens in this city, and we need more staff than we currently have.
Speaker 4: We don't need to be cut. And so I wanted to explain that to you all and make sure that you understand that balance. Government requires balanced budgets and independently elected branches of government should have can measure its size budgets.
Speaker 4: So pay attention to that as you guys are scanning this information because it's critical. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. And I apologize. Thank you, Councilmember Gilmore, for stepping in there, Councilman Hines.
Speaker 8: But thank you, Mr. President. Just to echo Councilmember CdeBaca point, the woman in the front to the BlackLivesMatter shirt, I'm sorry that I did not respond to you. There is me, one person who is sick and one person who took voluntary furloughs this past week.
Speaker 8: And so and that's it. That's that's all we got. So just to councilmember said about this point, we are we are very lean and we try to do as much as we can with what we have. But but we are very lean.
Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President.

"<document> (CNN)They took Yarmouk by storm, a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world's most beleaguered places. Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. ""They slaughtered them in the streets,"" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. ""They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp."" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in ""the deepest circle of hell,"" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. ""We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,"" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. ""The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning."" Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. ""According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014"" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. ""Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,"" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. ""The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,"" he said. ""And ISIS, I don't know ... they didn't do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as 'Yarmouk Islamic State.'"" </document> <Summary> Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area.

"<document> Before analyzing the benefits and costs of communications surveillance, I want to address some common misperceptions relating to its history, rationale, and efficacy. The first misperception is that communications surveillance is a new phenomenon. In reality it has a long history. Prior to the nineteenth century, communication pivoted around the horse and rider (and the roads on which they traversed) and around boats (and the ports at which their voyages began and ended). From the tenth century BCE through to the fifteenth century CE these modes of communication were subject to rudimentary forms of surveillance: messengers were intercepted and bags were opened; ports were embargoed and ships were searched. This pattern changed as European states, increasingly administered by professionals and reliably funded by taxes, took shape. This is when we first hear of “spymasters” like John Thurloe, secretary to the English Commonwealth's Council of State, who established in 1653 a Secret Office that opened, copied, and resealed suspicious letters over the course of a night. The innovation was adopted by the Stuarts and then expanded by the Hanoverians, making it one of the first organizations dedicated to communications surveillance. </document> <Summary> Before analyzing the benefits and costs of communications surveillance, I want to address some common misperceptions relating to its history, rationale, and efficacy.

"<document> A star college athlete and a classmate from Alabama's Troy University have been suspended after authorities discovered a cellphone video that allegedly shows them sexually assaulting a woman at a beach while a large crowd of spring-break revelers watches. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He says the footage shows several men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), have been officially suspended from Troy University in the wake of sexual assault claims . The two were arrested this week after police uncovered cellphone footage of the two of them assaulting an unconscious girl at the Spinnaker Beach Club in Panama City, Florida last month . The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case and additional arrests are expected. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun, of Mobile, Alabama pictured above in a picture from Facebook. Officials say they more arrests are expected . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.'

"<document> A gang of eight dug a 50m underground tunnel in an attempt to steal the ancient treasures inside a 1,400-year-old temple. The real-life tomb raiders began their daring plan by renting a restaurant across the road from Guanghui Temple in Zhengdin County, North China at the start of February. And while serving snacks to the public at the front of the building, a team on the inside was hard at work with shovels, ladders, and power drills - digging their way towards the temple's famous Hua Pagoda. Audacious plot: A seven-metre deep tunnel, which led to a 50m-long underground passage, was discovered by police when they raided the gang's property - across the road from Guanghui Temple . Historical site: The temple dates back to the Tang Dynasty and the Hua Pagoda (pictured) is nationally protected . The Criminal Investigation Bureau was tipped off about the group's audacious plan at the beginning of March and a task force was assigned to the case, reports People's Daily Online. After two days of investigation, police officers located the tunnel and were able to determine its source. They launched a sting operation four days later and five gang members were arrested - all of who confessed to plans to steal artefacts beneath the pagoda. The gang was just 20 metres away from breaching the Hua Pagoda when they were caught. Evidence of plan: Dozens of bags of earth dug up by the gang during their tunnelling were also found by police . Police questioning revealed that the gang's leader is a man named Zhang from Tianjin, North China. Zhang is a known artefact thief and his associates have also been involved in similar crimes in the past. They were able to hide their construction equipment from the rented property's landlord for more than a month - as it's thought they began digging around the Chinese New Year. After removing a board on the restaurant's floor, police discovered a seven-metre-deep tunnel that opened into a passage leading towards the Hua pagoda located 70 metres away. Almost succeeded: The gang had dug 50 metres towards the Hua Pagoda and were just 20 metres away from breaching it when they were foiled by police . Secret underground lair: The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the criminal gang was caught on March 6 . The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the gang was caught on March 6. Five were arrested and three people are still on the run. Guanghui Temple was built in Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and renovated in the five Dynasties (908-960 AD). It was destroyed during the war in late Qing Dynasty and the pagoda was the only monument remained intact. The Hua Pagoda is included in the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level (MHCSPNL) in 1961. Known to police: The gang's leader, Zhang, who was arrested, has a history of artefact theft . Concealed: The gang were able to hide their construction equipment from the rented property's landlord for more than a month . Raided by police: Five men were arrested following a tip-off, but three of the gang are now on the run . </document> <Summary> A gang of eight dug a 50m underground tunnel in an attempt to steal the ancient treasures inside a 1,400-year-old temple.

"<document> When the global financial crisis struck roughly a year ago, the blogosphere was ablaze with all sorts of scary predictions of, and commentary regarding, ensuing conflict and wars -- a rerun of the Great Depression leading to world war, as it were. Now, as global economic news brightens and recovery -- surprisingly led by China and emerging markets -- is the talk of the day, it's interesting to look back over the past year and realize how globalization's first truly worldwide recession has had virtually no impact whatsoever on the international security landscape. None of the more than three-dozen ongoing conflicts listed by GlobalSecurity.org can be clearly attributed to the global recession. Indeed, the last new entry (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah in the Palestine) predates the economic crisis by a year, and three quarters of the chronic struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican ""drug war"" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger (followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and liberation-themed terrorist movements. Besides the recent Russia-Georgia dust-up, the only two potential state-on-state wars (North v. South Korea, Israel v. Iran) are both tied to one side acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity -- a process wholly unrelated to global economic trends. And with the United States effectively tied down by its two ongoing major interventions (Iraq and Afghanistan-bleeding-into-Pakistan), our involvement elsewhere around the planet has been quite modest, both leading up to and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia's coast). Everywhere else we find serious instability we pretty much let it burn, occasionally pressing the Chinese -- unsuccessfully -- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example, hasn't led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces. So, to sum up: •No significant uptick in mass violence or unrest (remember the smattering of urban riots last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); •The usual frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places); •Not a single state-on-state war directly caused (and no great-power-on-great-power crises even triggered); •No great improvement or disruption in great-power cooperation regarding the emergence of new nuclear powers (despite all that diplomacy); •A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by the system's acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the strain); and •No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are Moscow's occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we've finally seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in the late 1980s, but even that's likely to wane given the stress on public budgets created by all this unprecedented ""stimulus"" spending. If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. Can we say that the world has suffered a distinct shift to political radicalism as a result of the economic crisis? Indeed, no. The world's major economies remain governed by center-left or center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both markets and trade. In the short run, there were attempts across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect, as much protectionism as allowed under current trade rules), but there was no great slide into ""trade wars."" Instead, the World Trade Organization is functioning as it was designed to function, and regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we say Islamic radicalism was inflamed by the economic crisis? If it was, that shift was clearly overwhelmed by the Islamic world's growing disenchantment with the brutality displayed by violent extremist groups such as al-Qaida. And looking forward, austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day, the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes, even as it has sparked a spirited -- and much needed, as I argued last week -- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it the beginning of ""economic warfare"" and the like between ""fading"" America and ""rising"" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated production chains and interconnected financial markets, such ""diverging interests"" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I don't welcome a world in which America's fiscal profligacy goes undisciplined, so bring it on -- please! Add it all up and it's fair to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience of America's post-World War II international liberal trade order. </document> <Summary> When the global financial crisis struck roughly a year ago, the blogosphere was ablaze with all sorts of scary predictions of, and commentary regarding, ensuing conflict and wars -- a rerun of the Great Depression leading to world war, as it were.

"<document> Everyone is watching Valencia’s 19-year-old left back Jose Luis Gaya with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea hoping to snatch him from under Real Madrid’s nose this summer. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson takes a look at the Spain under 21 defender. Why are English clubs so keen? His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m. When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you’re saying he can’t defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates’ mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool’s Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He’s not just an overlapper, he’s very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia’s academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He’s 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however. Marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play? A club like Arsenal could come in and promise far more first-team football which might sway him but Madrid are favourites. Gaya, pictured here at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup, has represented Spain up to under 21 standard . Gaya (left) talks to team-mate Federico Vico during an under 19 international against Germany . Real Madrid bought Danillo this week and now they want Gaya. And they already have Dani Carvajal and Mareclo. Are they building a team of full-backs? Reserve full-backs Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabio Coentrao have been identified as two of the weaknesses of the squad. They want Danillo and Carvajal contesting the right back position next season, and Gaya and Marcelo the left-back spot. Coentrao and Arebeloa will both be sold in the summer. There is also a Fifa investigation into their signing of under-age youngsters currently ongoing. With a potential transfer ban hanging over them they want to cover every gap in their squad. </document> <Summary> Everyone is watching Valencia’s 19-year-old left back Jose Luis Gaya with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea hoping to snatch him from under Real Madrid’s nose this summer.
His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m.
He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates’ mistakes.
He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place.

"<document> When father-of-three Sean McCabe got the devastating news that he had just two months to live he set about organising the funeral - choosing the music and even booking the church. But in an extraordinary twist his cancer went into remission and he has now changed his reservation for his wedding to his fiancee Lisa Williams. Mr McCabe, 30, of Tonyrefail, south Wales, even wrote a goodbye letter to his children for his partner to read to them once he had died after he was told he had stage four Hodgkin Lymphoma. Scroll down for video . Sean McCabe planned his own funeral after he was told he had just two months to live, but after making a recovery he was told he was in remission and has rebooked the church for his wedding to Lisa Williams (left) 'When the doctors said my chances of survival were slim, all I could think about was Lisa and the kids. I didn't know how they would cope without me,' said Mr McCabe, a security guard. 'Planning my funeral seemed like a way of easing the strain for them, as it would be one less ordeal for them to deal with.' The father-of-three was diagnosed with cancer in June 2013, then aged 28, and was started on an intensive chemotherapy course. He was given the all-clear in September but just two months later told the cancer had returned in an even more aggressive form. He was expected to live for eight weeks. Mr McCabe was told his cancer had returned aggressively and is pictured after chemotherapy in 2014 . Doing all he could to cope with his diagnosis, Mr McCabe booked St David's Church for his funeral, in late January 2014. He instructed Miss Williams to ensure his favourite song, 'Who You Are' by Jessie J was played, and ordered mourners not to wear black. As preparations got underway he picked the site for his family to scatter his ashes, and penned a heart-wrenching letter to be read to his children after his death, telling them: 'I don't want to leave you or mammy, but I haven't got an option.' But he managed to make a remarkable recovery and was told his cancer is now in remission. He said: 'A year ago I was planning my funeral at that church, and now I'm planning our wedding there. The father-of-three (centre) made a miraculous recovery and is pictured with his family (from left to right) Sumer McCabe, 8, Lisa Williams, 30, Asia McCabe, 7, and Kian McCabe, 12 . Mr McCabe wrote a note to this three children to be read out to them by their mother after he died . 'When Lisa walks down the aisle with our children as page boy and flower girls I'll be fighting back tears, because we could have been in that church under very different circumstances.' He is now due to marry Miss Williams July 25, surrounded by their three children Kian, 11, eight-year-old Summer and Asia, six. The couple have been together for 12 years. Miss Williams said: 'It's been a real rollercoaster ride, but I'm thrilled to finally being married to the man of my dreams. 'He may have planned his own funeral, but I will definitely not let him plan the wedding all on his own.' Mr McCabe is pictured with Miss Williams before he got ill (left), and in December 2012 with his son Kian, just before he began to feel pain and went to his GP . In December 2013 Mr McCabe was told he had a 20 per cent chance of survival (left). The next year he was undergoing chemotherapy and about to have a bone marrow transplant (right) after the cancer returned . Mr McCabe has revealed the contents of the letter he wrote to this three children. It said: 'To Kian, Summer, Asia, the most amazing children. 'You have given me the best years of my life. Now I want you to know Daddy loves you and you will always be in my thoughts. 'I don't want to leave you or mammy, but I haven't got an option. Mr McCabe, 30, said he is looking forward to marrying his long term partner Lisa Williams (left) In December 2014 Mr McCabe was recovering and had been told his cancer was now in remission . Mr McCabe's fiancee and three children went out to celebrate his cancer being in remission in December 2014 . 'Daddy has to you to heaven and you might not see me, but I will be watching over you always. 'I want you to be happy because that makes me happy. 'Now turn that frown upside down and be big and brave for Daddy, ok. Xxxxxxxxxx . 'And Kian my handsome boy, look after your two sisters for me and mammy. For me, butty.

"<document> Over the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will lead the country until an election is called within 30 days. At this point, there is a massive amount of uncertainty behind the scenes. Uncertainty is dangerous in a market such as oil. Supply lines around the world are quite tight. This means that a disruption along the supply chain would have a severe impact on oil prices internationally. In the long run, it would be quite beneficial if a market-oriented leader emerged. This would provide long-term investing opportunities for businesses that can provide technological expertise as well as experience in helping to extract the abundance of various commodities from the ground. This would help keep oil prices relatively low. However, I think the transition period will be quite volatile. Remember that a lot of international companies had their assets seized by the Venezuelan government. While there is the potential for long-term investing opportunities, I’m not sure international companies would be willing to take a chance on a country that has shown disrespect for the law in the past. In addition, it is commonly known that the Venezuelan oil industry is poorly run. A shift in power might add confusion, which might increase the chances of a disruption in production, leading to volatility in oil prices. It would be beneficial for Americans to have a leader that could help Venezuelans by allowing international firms with modern technology to help develop the vast wealth within that nation. But this could create long-term investing opportunities for companies that could provide advanced skills and knowledge. This could also keep oil prices in check, creating a vast supply of oil between Venezuela, the U.S., and Canada. </document> <Summary> Over the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will lead the country until an election is called within 30 days.

Innovation and research in the maritime economy can drive a European growth and jobs recovery whilst securing a sustainable future for Europe's seas, oceans, and all those whose livelihoods depend on them. That is the focus of this year's European Maritime Day held in Bremen, Germany, on 19-20 May which will host an exchange of ideas between experts, stakeholders from all maritime sectors and policy makers from across the EU. Commissioner Damanaki as co-host of the event, stated ahead of this year's European Maritime Day: ""Europe's economy is still in choppy waters and we have a duty to maximise every drop of potential to help its recovery. Our seas and oceans have this potential in abundance. We are committed to exploring how best they can help us create jobs and growth – but in a way that does not compromise on our ecosystems. The European Maritime Day is an occasion for the maritime community to discuss how to make sure that growth and sustainability go hand in hand in the blue economy"". The European Commission's Blue Growth agenda seeks to make sustainability the cornerstone for maritime growth, and will therefore be at the heart of the discussions in Bremen. Set against a backdrop of recent announcements by the EU on Blue Innovation, Maritime Spatial Planning, Coastal and Maritime tourism and Ocean energy, the event will bring together each sector of the maritime economy to discuss how they can co-operate, share insights, and make sustainable growth a reality. </document> <Summary> The theme for this year's conference is 'Innovation driving Blue Growth'.

"<document> A woman charged with having sex with a dog has whacked a photographer over the head with a bottle and told him to 'f--k off' outside court on Saturday afternoon. Jenna Louise Driscoll was leaving a Brisbane's City Watch House after fronting the court for failing to appear on April 7. The 25-year-old lashed out and hit a photographer on the forehead with a plastic bottle before hurling abuse at him. Woman charged with having sex with a dog has lashed out at a photographer and hit him over the head . Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug and unlawful wounding . Ms Driscoll was arrested on Friday afternoon after she turned up at Stafford police station to fulfill her regular bail conditions. Police had allegedly issued a warrant for her arrest after she failed to appear in court on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality. According to the Courier Mail, Ms Driscoll pleaded guilty before Magistrate Bronwyn Springer for failing to previously appear in court and was fined $250 for the offence . She was released on conditional bail, which requires her to report to police, abide by residential conditions and not speak to the complainant. Police found the videos of Ms Driscoll allegedly having sex with a dog while investigating text messages on her mobile phone for allegedly dealing cannabis in October. She fronted Brisbane court on Saturday for failing to previously appear on April 7 . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Ms Driscoll was charged last year with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson. She will face court again on April 27.

"<document> A pre-med student in New York City is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line. Lizzie Cochran, a student at Columbia University, has launched a KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line Epidemia Designs, which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes, and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history. 'The one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus,' Lizzie told Today. 'It was one of the most devastating epidemics in the history of the world, but there on the page, colored with dyes, it just looked incredible, interesting and vibrant.' Scroll down for video . From the microscope to the mat: Proposed clothing line Epidemia will take images from biology and print them on eye-catching active apparel . Picture of health: Among the designs is a sports bra showing images from a healthy mammogram . Lizzie, who will be returning to her native Texas for medical school in the fall at University of Texas San Antonio, was soon mocking up ideas for clothing incorporating the beautiful and unique imagery she'd seen on slides during her classes. Using mirroring, Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects, each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern that could be printed on fabric. The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio, muscle cells and rabies. The patterns will also be available for printing on iPhone cases after the company, which has already raised $13,798, reaches its $15,000 crowdfunding goal. In her design work, Lizzie also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases, as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they haven't been vaccinated. The brains of the outfit: Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope . Giving 'cell phone' a whole new meaning: Epidemia will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue, chicken pox and polio . From the Petri dish to the yoga pant: Epidemia legging,s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured, will initially be priced at around $75 . 'Frankly, it's unacceptable,' Lizzie told Today. 'It's not like we're trying to solve an unsolvable problem. We really have the power to lead the way toward a healthier future. We already have the tools.' With this idea in mind, Lizzie is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio, rubella and hepatitis, as well as expanding medical care access around the globe. Now, with an expanding team - and an exploding online following - Epidemia's goal of $15,000 has nearly been reached, meaning the line is just on the cusp of going into production. Team Epidemia: Based on the strength of her idea, Lizzie has enlisted a new VP of retail, Taylor Newby (third from right), and several friends as models for the project . Showing off their muscles: The Kickstarter campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $15,000 . The first group of designs lined up will be called 'She's Got It' will have the theme of beauty in a woman's body and will feature images of brain, nerve, heart and epithelial (stomach). Aside from bringing awareness of preventable diseases to the forefront, the 'She's Got It' line has its own unique purpose. 'We hope women will wear these clothes and feel empowered to join the discussions of public health, science and technology that are so vital to our world,' Lizzie explained. 'Our hope is that our stylish, feminine, fun, and most importantly, interesting designs will appeal to girls of all ages - and maybe encourage them to get involved in the scientific community.' </document> <Summary> A pre-med student in New York City is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line.
Lizzie Cochran, a student at Columbia University, has launched a KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line Epidemia Designs.
Using mirroring, Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects, each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern that could be printed on fabric.
The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio, muscle cells and rabies.
In her design work, Lizzie also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases, as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they haven't been vaccinated.
With this idea in mind, Lizzie is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio, rubella and hepatitis, as well as expanding medical care access around the globe.

"<document> (CNN)A Saudi-led coalition Tuesday ended its ""Operation Decisive Storm"" -- its nearly monthlong airstrike campaign in Yemen -- and a new initiative is underway. ""Operation Renewal of Hope"" will focus on the political process. Saudi Arabia had launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in the capital Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives ""by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,"" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to ""nearly all demands"" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back Yemen's ""security and stability through establishing a political process,"" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Ousted Yemen President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi thanked the Saudi-led coalition. Hadi claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. ""We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,"" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at ""the right time"" to rebuild the country. ""You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,"" said Hadi. Also Tuesday, a U.S. military official told CNN that the United States is conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report. </document> <Summary> Saudi Arabia had launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power.

"<document> China was the only member nation on the Security Council to abstain from a resolution to condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea. But analysts say Beijing's support for Moscow faces limits. ""On one hand, Russia's strong-arm tactics and meddling in Ukraine are at odds with China's long-standing commitment to the inviolability of state sovereignty,"" said Benjamin Herscovitch , a research fellow with Australia's Centre for Independent Studies. ""On the other hand, Moscow's disregard for Washington's denunciations pleases Beijing."" There is also a practical reason for Beijing to refrain from endorsing Russia's military invasion: it might give foreign powers an excuse to intervene in China's own territories in the future. Beijing maintains a strong grip on its far-flung, ethnically diverse Xinjiang and Tibet regions. And the 2005 Anti-Secession Law permits the use of military force against Taiwan, should it declare independence through a referendum or some other official mechanism. ""China is highly ambivalent towards the referendum in Crimea as it is uneasy about the potential implications for its own territorial or ethnic minority issues,"" said Chengxin Pan , a fellow with Australian Institute of International Affairs. Sharing more than 4,000 kilometres of border with Russia, China is also worried about the risk of a wider Russian incursion as nationalistic leader Vladimir Putin pokes at Western weakness and tries to restore Moscow's influence over its old Soviet empire. Beijing has bitter memories of Soviet military action in smaller countries, such as Hungary in 1953 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, which enraged Mao Zedong enough to launch a campaign against ""social imperialism"". Russian forces helped push Chinese troops out of Mongolia beginning in 1920, and Ukraine's return to the Kremlin's orbit has echoes of ""Finlandisation"" during the cold war, when the Soviet Union influenced the Nordic country's polices. </document> <Summary> China was the only member nation on the Security Council to abstain from a resolution to condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea.

"<document> A Florida university is investigating the death of a student who drowned in Daytona Beach to determine whether or not hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, was reported missing after going swimming with student s at 3am on Sunday and students who were with him said strong currents pulled Parks out to sea. His body was found Monday morning. Students who were with Parks, who were all part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year, said no hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned in Daytona Beach on Sunday after going for a swim with friends at 3am. He was pulled out to see by a strong current and his body was later found on Monday morning . But Bethune-Cookman University is investigating Parks death after university administration 'heard rumors' that hazing was involved. Parks and the men he was swimming with were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year . A Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Keisha Boyd said that the university administration had 'heard rumors' about hazing and that Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is investigating the student's death, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Parks' mother, Carolyn Parks, said she didn't know why her son would decide to swim in the ocean. 'I don't know why it happened, why he would go into the water like this, because he is not a good swimmer,' she told WESH 2. 'And I had talked to him just before he came out here and he told me he was tired and was going to rest, not knowing he was going to come out here to the beach.' Damian Parks is the second son Carolyn Parks has had to mourn in recent months. Her 16-year-old son died in Miami six months ago. Parks was with four other men in about 5ft of water near Sun Splash Park when he lost grip of a friend's clothing and a the current pulled him out to sea, according to a U.S. Coast Guard report. Parks' friends said that there was 'no foul play at all' and that is was not hazing. They added that the group was 'having fun' and that Parks had not been drinking before the incident . Uamil Turner, who was at the beach, said 'it wasn't hazing', and he was unsure where the rumor came from. Marquise Nelson, who was also at the beach with Parks, said that there 'was no foul play at all'. 'Damian didn't do anything he didn't want to do, and everyone knew that,' Nelson told the News-Journal. 'Everyone was having fun.' Parks friends said that the student had not been drinking the night he drowned nor was he impaired in any way. Deputy Chief Ray Manchester of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said there's no sign of hazing in the incident and that the men had, however, been out bar-hopping before going for a swim. He added that he believed 'they may have been drinking' and that the ocean was rough when the men entered the water. Students and staff at Bethune-Cookman University mourned Parks' death during a prayer vigil held on Monday after the student's body was found . The university said that though the investigation is ongoing, it still wants to celebrate Parks' life and support his family 'in this most difficult time' The university is investigating into hazing, while Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is assisting with toxicology and witness statements, Manchester said. Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Boyd said that though the investigation was ongoing, the university is still celebrating Parks' life. 'Once any additional information is provided by the Beach Patrol, the University will issue another statement. While information regarding the events of April 20th are continuing to surface, we ask that the public join B-CU in supporting the Parks family in this most difficult time,' she said. The university held a prayer vigil on Monday, in which University President Edison Jackson planted a tree in Parks' memory. Students at the vigil said that Parks 'never stopped laughing' and was both talented and artistic. During Monday's vigil, University President Edison planted a tree in Parks' memory. More than 100 people appeared to have shown up for Monday's vigil . </document> <Summary> Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, was reported missing after going swimming with student s at 3am on Sunday and students who were with him said strong currents pulled Parks out to sea.

"<document> Pensioners aged over 75 will be guaranteed same-day appointments with their GP, as part of Tory plans for a huge cash injection for the NHS. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service. This is the figure named by NHS boss Simon Stevens as the amount needed to help plug a £30billion hole in the health service’s accounts over the next five years. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service . Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to health service . The move is designed to demolish cynical Labour claims that the Tories would ‘cut the NHS to the bone’ and will mean ‘at least’ an extra £8billion a year for the NHS by 2020. The Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to the health service. However, the promise that all over-75s will get a guaranteed same-day GP appointment will raise eyebrows among critics who say GPs are already struggling to cope. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs, which Tory sources said last night would allow them to deliver the same-day pledge. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the move as a ‘good start’, but warned that, on current trends, an extra 8,000 GPs would be needed by 2020 just to stand still. Mr Hunt said: ‘The NHS has set out its vision for how we best improve the health service for patients, and today we are backing that plan with the money it needs. But we can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy. ‘We need to do much more to ensure our vulnerable elderly can be treated in the community. That is why we are building on our decision to bring back named GPs for the over-75s by ensuring that, as part of this, they are guaranteed a same-day GP service when they need it. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs . ‘This means family doctors can focus on giving elderly people the care they need, and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital.’ The guarantee will build on the new ‘proactive care programme’, which requires GPs to offer a priority service to their most vulnerable 2 per cent of patients. The decision to back the ‘Stevens plan’ is designed to neutralise Labour attacks on the issue. Mr Cameron said the commitment to find the money would be included in next week’s Conservative Party manifesto. Referring to the care given to his late son Ivan, the Prime Minister said: ‘As someone who has been supported by the NHS at the most difficult time in my life, I’m utterly committed to ensuring it is there for everyone when they need it too. ‘That’s why I’m backing the NHS’s own plan with the cash required to ensure it can continue to deliver an amazing service to patients and their families in the future.’ The Tory move will pile pressure on Labour to put its money where its mouth is on the NHS. This week, Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said he could not commit to Mr Stevens’s five-year plan, adding: ‘I’m not in the business of making false promises or giving cheques to the NHS that will bounce a few days after the election.’ Tory sources last night insisted the money could be found through efficiency savings and the proceeds of economic growth. They pointed to official figures showing that NHS spending has increased by £7billion in real terms since 2010, despite the austerity programme. A source said: ‘We have delivered a £7billion increase even when the economy was really struggling from Labour’s recession in the first few years. Now we have got years of economic growth forecast, so it is do-able and we will do it.’ </document> <Summary> As part of Tory plans for an £8 billion NHS cash injection, pensioners over 75 will get guaranteed same-day GP appointments.
The pledge aims to refute Labour claims the Tories would cut the NHS to the bone and provide the funding called for by NHS head Simon Stevens.
Critics question if GPs can deliver this service as they already struggle to cope, though there are plans to train more GPs.
The move puts pressure on Labour to match funding pledges and is designed to neutralize attacks on the NHS issue. </Summary>"

"<document> Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video . Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co . According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire . Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him . She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state. </document> <Summary> Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016.

"<document> Hull midfielder David Meyler says he is totally convinced the Tigers will hang on to their Premier League status. Steve Bruce's side are in 15th place, three points off the relegation zone, but have a tough run-in with five of their last eight matches against clubs in the top seven of the Premier League. The Tigers have impressed however against top sides, drawing 1-1 away at Manchester City and losing 3-2 at the hands of Chelsea in a match they could easily have won. Hull midfielder David Meyler is confident his side will remain in the top flight despite their recent poor form . The Tigers will be hoping to bounce back from their 3-2 home defeat by Chelsea when they face Swansea . Hull are currently just three points above Burnley . Speaking ahead of the weekend meeting with Swansea, Meyler said: 'We are not going down. We just have to get into the mentality that it is not good enough to accept the 3-2 defeat by Chelsea, even if they are likely Premier League champions. 'We had some great chances and we need to win these games when you get into those positions.' He added: 'We're down to the last eight games now and this is where we have to earn our money. 'This is the period when everything will be decided so we've got eight games to make sure we finish as well as we can and that is what we aim to do. 'We finished 17th last season and at the moment, we're 15th this season so we're a little bit ahead. Hull trio Mohamed Diame (pictured), James Chester and Gaston Ramirez could feature against Swansea . 'What we want to do here is maintain Premier League status for a number of years to come and we'll do what we have to do to achieve that aim and build this club. We're looking to develop every year. 'We've got eight games to come, against some decent teams, but I'm sure we can get the wins we need if we keep performing like we did in games against the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool and for 70 minutes against Chelsea. 'It will be tough against Swansea but we're going there with the mentality that we can get some points.' Hull will be hugely boosted by the return of Senegal midfielder Mohamed Diame after a long injury absence, and James Chester is also back in the squad to face Swansea. Gaston Ramirez is fit to play despite concerns about an injury picked up on international duty. </document> <Summary> Hull midfielder David Meyler says he is totally convinced the Tigers will hang on to their Premier League status.

"<document> The normativism, cultural imperialism and ethnocentrism of some environmental organizations and animal rights activists capture the Makah whalers in essentialized images of culture and tradition and puts pressure on them to conform to the formers’ worldviews and standards. The image of the ‘ecological Indian’, a culture hero created to a large extent by the environmentalist movement, seems to have been replaced once more by an image of the not so noble savage. The criticism directed against the whale hunt became focused on the authenticity of the Makah’s way of reinventing tradition: ‘Notions and essentialized theories on traditional Indian-ness became markers of authority; the non-Indian was deciding and valuing what it was to be an Indian.’57 Apparently, the Makah had to authenticate themselves as ‘genuine’ Makah. In the American case, popular culture is replete with representations of what a ‘real Indian’ is and what ‘authentic’ behavior should be (Erikson 1999:575). Alx Dark, who has studied the Makah whaling conflict in detail, states that the comments of opponents of the hunt ‘have frequently drawn from general, romantic and neo-colonial ideologies about Native Americans’. He adds: ‘This ideological framework allows whaling opponents to dismiss any Makah claim of cultural continuity by citing evidence of cultural change. : : : whaling opponents have at times suggested that Makah cultural aspirations are   “inauthentic”, usually in the process of telling the Makah what their culture was, is or ought to be.’58 Dark further remarks: ‘[T]he Makah are told their modernity “proves” they are no longer “authentically” Makah.’ He takes the stance that ‘the Makah have a right to perpetuate their culture, adapting it to meet new needs. The Makah should not have to choose between putting their culture under glass, or abandoning it entirely in order to participate in American society and the world economy.’59 But any contemporary culture is forged or manufactured to the extent that actors play with a reservoir of available sets of cultural repertoires, deriving meaning from the selected elements. To achieve this end, they can select from a contingent and open field of symbols, objects, and experiences (Miller 1994:321-322). In the sense that any culture, identity or tradition is constructed, reconstructed, invented or reinvented, it is impossible to argue that there is such a thing as an ‘authentic’ culture, identity or tradition (Turney 1999:424) – at least if we take authenticity to mean genuine, original, pure, uncorrupted, pristine, untouched, real, true (Handler 1986:2). Such a mistaken perception sees authenticity as fixed essence, persistent over time. Here we enter the domain of identity politics and the politics of representation. Environmentalists see cultural heritage as something static, as a ‘snapshot’ version of culture at some point in time not as a dynamic force with multiple meanings. This ‘strategic projection of non-Indian stereotypes regarding indigenous lifeways’ went along with ‘deeply ethnocentric visions of what qualifies as authentic culture’ (Sepez-Aradanas and Tweedie 1999:48). Makah whalers regard some traditions worth pursuing or revitalizing as part of an articulated bricolage that is important in identity formation. Doshi argues that ‘the Makah framed their whale hunt as an integral part of their culture – implying, then, that tribal culture is something static that must be recovered and restored for the psychic health of the community’ (2002:95). To some extent, there is indeed an element of essentializing the cultural aspect by the Makah. However, she misses the point that it is an element of their culture that the Makah wish to articulate in their identity politics. It is a ‘strategic essentialism’ (Gaard 2001:17) in the political struggle for self-determination in a postcolonial context. Moreover, the Makah have always adapted and accommodated their culture to economic and political change. For instance, after contact with Europeans, the Makah traded their whale and seal products with them and incorporated new materials such as metal in their harpoons (Dougherty 2001).They even provided the oil to lubricate the machinery in industrializing west coast America. More to the point is Greta Gaard’s criticism that ‘the whale hunting practices of a certain elite group of men have been conflated with the practices and substituted for the identity of an entire culture’ (Gaard 2001:17). Indeed, archeological evidence would seem to indicate that whaling was the preserve of ‘big men’ seeking prestige behavior.60 But appropriation and articulation of this particular aspect of Makah history and culture would seem to have provided the tribe with a charter for cultural resurrection or even cultural survival. </document> <Summary> The normativism, cultural imperialism and ethnocentrism of some environmental organizations and animal rights activists capture the Makah whalers in essentialized images of culture and tradition and puts pressure on them to conform to the formers’ worldviews and standards.

"<document> Unfortunately, these examples are the exception, not the rule. In fact, we’re woefully behind in developing rigorous, scalable, and useful assessment systems that span prekindergarten through high school. Developing such assessment systems is critical to the entire SEL endeavor. If we want to make a measurable difference, we need to develop SEL assessment systems that are usable, feasible, and psychometrically sound. What is the current state of assessment? At this early stage, social and emotional assessments can only be used for limited purposes. Many teacher rating scales, and some direct assessments in some grades, can guide instruction, because they help teachers understand students’ strengths and needs (this is called formative assessment). Other assessments may be useful for monitoring progress, for guiding the development of special education interventions, or for evaluating programs and tracking students’ social and emotional development over time. Even for these specific purposes, however, the range of options is limited. Furthermore, fewer SEL assessments possess the rigorous psychometric properties we demand of assessments used for high-stakes accountability. One important question regards the extent to which SEL assessment should be used to measure teacher or school accountability. That said, important work is under way in California, as part of the CORE district experiment, to explore the use of students’ social and emotional self-reports as one part of a multifaceted district accountability plan. The CORE experiment will provide real-life lessons about the promises and pitfalls of SEL assessment for accountability purposes. </document> <Summary> Unfortunately, these examples are the exception, not the rule.

'£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' read one banner, held across the home and away fans before kick-off. Hopefully the irony wasn't lost on Sterling, even if it did not interfere with his football. It was a difficult afternoon for Raheem Sterling, who toiled as Arsenal surged to victory over Liverpool . Sterling (centre) is crowded out by Arsenal players as he struggled to impose himself on the game . Sterling was brought down by Hector Bellerin for Liverpool's penalty, which was only a consolation . Sterling tussles with Per Mertersacker (left) and struggled to repeatedly threaten Arsenal's defence . Crowd reaction: . Quite indifferent. A few jeers from the Arsenal fans now and then, but nothing serious. They wouldn't want to put him off. After all, he's flattered by the interest. No notable dissent from Liverpool fans, away in the far corner. They joined his appeals for a penalty when he had been nudged over by Hector Bellerin. Body Language: . Good. Bright and busy. Energetic, showed willingly for the ball and didn't shirk the physical battle with Per Mertesacker in the first half. Keen to pick up the ball and run in the second half. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks on as Sterling watches the play unfold . Sterling was positioned in an advanced role for Liverpool, a position he admits he prefers playing . Sterling looks dejected as Liverpool were comfortably beaten by Arsenal in the Premier League . Position: . Started up front where he likes it (and not at wing-back where it seems he doesn’t) because Daniel Sturridge was only fit enough for the bench after the hip injury which ruled him out of England duty. Jordan Henderson deputised at right-wing-back. Sturridge came on to replace Lazar Markovic at the break, with Liverpool three down. Sterling dropped to be one of the support strikers, from the left.

Sterling (right) takes the ball beyond Arsenal midfield player Aaron Ramsey at The Emirates . Sterling (centre) is blocked off by Bellerin of Arsenal, who scored the opener after 37 minutes . Interaction . Limited. Played up front alone. Nothing much to celebrate. Hugs and handshakes after the match for a few Arsenal players but not with his team-mates.

"<document> The effect of deconstructing the power of the author to impose a fixed meaning on the text or offer a continuous narrative is both debilitating and liberating. It is debilitating in that any attempt to say what should be done within even our insular Foucaultian preoccupations may be oppositionalized and deconstructed as an illegitimate privileging of one term, value, perspective or narrative over another. The struggle over meaning might continue ad infinitum. That is, if a deconstructionist is theoretically consistent and sees deconstruction not as a political tool but as a philosophical orientation, political action is impossible, because such action requires a degree of closure that deconstruction, as a theoretical matter, does not permit.

"<document> In the Israeli, German, and Indian cases, a much more attractive military solution was eventually discovered. Although we can never be certain, it appears that had the Germans, the Indians, and the Israelis not discovered the blitzkrieg, they would have launched limited offensives. Surely the risks would have been considerable (especially in the German case), but given the pressure in each in-stance to take some military action, war probably could not have been avoided. Although a limited aims strategy is hardly ever an attractive option, it is usually not so unattractive that deterrence obtains in a crisis. Finally, there are the cases in which, despite the pressure to find an acceptable military plan, none is forthcoming. In essence, if the attacker chooses to go to war, he is likely either to lose or to find himself engaged in a lengthy war of attrition. Given such circumstances, deterrence is almost certain to hold, as it did for the Allies at Munich and again during the months immediately preceding and following the start of the Second World War. The Allies, however, did formally declare war against Germany, although it seems clear that they would never have attacked Germany had Germany not at-tacked first. Their decision to declare war highlights the intensity of the pressure to take military action against Germany. After their humiliating defeat in 1967, the Egyptians soon carne to believe that some. form of military action against Israel would be necessary. The Egyptians, however, were deterred from starting a conventional war because they feared that they would be defeated. They therefore turned to the war of attrition.28 Conventional deterrence obtained in the Middle East between 1967 and 1973, although this state of affairs certainly did not constitute peace. Throughout the period the Egyptians were preparing themselves to fight against Israel. By late 1972, they had reached the point where they could seriously consider engaging the Israelis in a conventional war. Rec-ognizing that such a course of action entailed serious risks, the Egyptians nevertheless struck in October 1973. Their behavior clearly shows that when a nation is dissatisfied with the status quo, the long-term prospects for deterrence are not promising. The pressure to find an acceptable military solution will be too intense. [211 ] Conclusion THE NATO BALANCE From our analysis of the conventional balance in Central Europe, we may conclude that the prospects for conventional deterrence in some future crisis are quite good. The conventional wisdom not-withstanding, assessment of the balance of forces and the capabilities of each side makes plain that the Pact could not presently expect to score a quick and decisive victory against NATO. Moreover, the on-going proliferation of PGMs appears likely to enhance NATO's position in the immediate future. Although these weapons are clearly not ""super weapons"" that will render the tank extinct, they make it more difficult for the Soviets to effect a blitzkrieg and thus can only increase the likelihood of deterrence. NATO policy makers have good reason, however, to be very cautious when assessing their position in some future crisis. For the cases examined here show that, when a nation has a powerful motive for war, it will go to great lengths to find a suitable military strat-egy. Military planners will be subjected to unremitting pressure. Furthermore, a defender who becomes complacent is likely to be surprised, as were the Israelis in 1973 and the Allies in May 1940. The central message for status quo powers is clear: beware in a crisis, because your opponent is seeking a way to defeat you. </document> <Summary> The Germans, the Indians, and the Israelis would have launched limited offensives had they not discovered the blitzkrieg.

"<document> UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones ran from a crash that hospitalised a pregnant woman - but quickly came back to grab 'a large handful of cash' from the car, witnesses told police. According to police, the accident occurred in southeastern Albuquerque just before noon on Sunday local time when the driver of a rented SUV jumped a red light. The driver, whom an off-duty officer identified as Jones, ran from the scene but then returned for the cash before fleeing again, police said. 'Witnesses stated he shoved the cash into his pants and ran north jumping the fence,' the report said. Officers found a pipe with marijuana in the vehicle as well as MMA and rental car documents in Jones' name, according to the police report. Police were searching for UFC  champion Jon Jones in connection with a hit-and-run accident . Albuquerque police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday. They said he would likely face a felony charge of leaving the scene of an accident since the woman broke her arm in the crash. Police said in a news release they'd been unable to reach Jones or his lawyer. However, Jones handed himself in later the same day, with TMZ reporting he was being held at Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. According to the warrant, the pregnant woman told police she was driving when she was hit by a silver Buick SUV. According to the document, she told authorities after the accident  'I am pregnant and I feel like I am going to pass out. My arm is hurting all the way up and my husband is going to take me to the hospital.' The woman's arm is in a sling and she will get a cast on Tuesday, the warrant said. According to the warrant, she was planning to undergo a Monday ultrasound. The warrant also said the off-duty officer  told responding police he could confirm Jones' identity because 'I watch UFC all the time, I know what Jon Jones looks like.' An agent for Jones, Malki Kawa, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from Daily Mail Online on Monday. Kawa also did not immediately respond to a message from Associated Press. Jones (21-1) is scheduled to defend his title against Anthony 'Rumble'Johnson at UFC 187 in Las Vegas on May 23, headlining one of the promotion's biggest shows of the year. Police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday, saying he would likely face a felony charge . Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour during his time as a UFC champion . 'We are aware that the Albuquerque Police Department is interested in speaking to Jon Jones regarding his possible involvement in a motor vehicle accident,' the UFC said in a Sunday statement. The message continued: 'We are in the process of gathering facts and will reserve further comment until more information is available.' Although he is widely considered the world's best pound-for-pound mixed martial artist, Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour as champion.

"<document> It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster. Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast. The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping £41,000 ($60,000). Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish . Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912 . A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive . The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths. Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd. 'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria. 'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure. The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss. The starboard railing near the bow of the Titanic. Expeditions take place in a MIR I or II submersible, which is able to withstand the water pressure 12500ft below the surface . The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface . Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on April 14, 1912. Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments . The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists . Since Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site . However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship. Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told CNN Money. After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world’s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia . Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for £6,820 ($10,000). The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients. The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being £3,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience. Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage . </document> <Summary> It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster.

Speaker 3: Good evening. Members of the City Council, my friend Cassidy. I live on Bay Street and I'm opposed this ordinance for several reasons. First off, I believe it's a dishonest ordinance. It's purporting to be about the safety of the food supply.
Speaker 3: And yet, when Council member Odie broached this months ago, the only thing he discussed was layoffs at a particular grocery store. Secondly, it's about an imagined problem, not a real problem. There's, you know, predictions that Wal-Mart's going to be taking over grocery stores.
Speaker 3: But are they doing that? No, it just we're just guessing that's going to be a problem. But my biggest concern is the message it gives to the business community. We have significant vacancies in office space. We have significant vacancies in retail space.
Speaker 3: We got to populate Alameda Point with tenants at some point. And here we are telling the business community that our city council will enact rules about how they can hire and fire people. It's not a real welcoming thing.
Speaker 3: It can turn businesses off. And I think in the long run, it might actually result in fewer jobs in Alameda. So those are my concerns. Thank you.

This this it's my understanding this is being brought to us to approve because there's a California state case that went up to the California state Supreme Court. Supporting the proposition that it is to provide safe food supply to our community.
Speaker 0: And I and I don't want to speak for the other council members, but we have had discussion about that and. And in the end, it only applies to stores that are over 15,000 square feet. Groceries as a high percentage of the store has to have food items.
Speaker 0: Is there anything else that's particularly true that does not provide pertain to stores across the community is very limited. All right. All those in favor. I a motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Regular agenda items.

#Person1#: Oh, right-anyway, CAD and..., and English. That's quite a range. Don't you want to do maths-or computer programming, for example? Why don't you choose to do art and design?
#Person2#: Well, I'm interested in electronics-in computer-especially in writing computer games. I'd like to produce educational software, educational games, eventually. I've taught myself a lot of programming- I... I don't think I'd benefit much from a foundation level course.
#Person1#: No... no, I see that-go on.
#Person2#: So, er, I want the basics-the physical science and electronics I was hopeless at physics in school and we didn't have electronics-but I was good at maths-I don't think I need that.
#Person1#: And the art and design?
#Person2#: That will be good for my graphics-I need that to produce games-CAD too-I've never done CAD before.
#Person1#: No-right-they've got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices-you'll enjoy that. So... that leaves English. It's mostly English lit. I know your English is very good, but did you know you can take English as a foreign language as one of the modules in the foundation year?
#Person2#: No... no, I didn't. That's great - if they've got classes at my level. I don't have any problem speaking-but my writing is terrible.
#Person1#: Oh, I'm sure they have-go and talk to them in the EAP department-oh, and I suggest you join the study-skill classes, too. They will have sessions on report and so on.
#Person2#: Great-I really need some help with my writing, especially spelling.
#Person1#: Well, that would be in the EFL classes-study-skills would help more with how to structure your essays and so on... now, your last module...
#Person2#: Yeh... well... I gave up biology at school to do physical-but I much prefer biology -I'd like to study some more While I can but German is very important in technical subjects, so I want to do that too.
#Person1#: Well, you could do it as an option next year-you do know that?
#Person2#: No, I don't-I mean, I didn't cheek.
#Person1#: Yes... yes, I think that's the thing to do-concentrate on your English this year you could take Cambridge proficiency-and you'll need LELTS for the first year of the degree -start the German next year.
#Person2#: Right-that sounds good.
#Person1#: Good. Well, if you have any problems academic or otherwise, just come and see me.
#Person2#: OK, thanks.
#Person1#: I am on extension 7549.
#Person2#: 7549.
#Person1#: That's it-just leave a message if I'm not in the office-OK, if there is nothing else...
#Person2#: No... no, that's fine, thanks.
#Person1#: Good-bye for now, then.
#Person2#: Bye. </document> <Summary> Have you settled in? 
Yes, I feel quite at home now.
Good. Now we'd better make sure you enjoy your studies. -do you know what you want to do yet? 
Yes, more or less, but I'm not sure whether to do biological sciences or German.
I gave up biology at school to do physical-but I much prefer biology -I'd like to study some more While I can but German is very important in technical subjects, so I want to do that too.

"<document> A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. But many admit they know where they are going wrong . If you are thinking of attempting some DIY this weekend watch out – nearly seven in ten of us end up injured. A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent said they or their partner had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. Two in five had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes. A careless one in 30 suffered after getting paint or chemicals in their eyes and eight in 100 had fallen off a ladder, said research for the makers of pain relief brands Deep Heat and Deep Freeze. But a significant number of hapless handymen and women know where they're going wrong. One in 10 said they failed to follow instructions or research the right way to do the job, while one in five came to grief taking a shortcut. Men are a third more likely than women to try to cut corners when doing a job. Top of the nation's to-do list is DIY and decorating, with eight in 10 Brits catching up on everything from odd jobs to major makeovers round the home . However, it seems DIYers are failing to prepare properly for a weekend of exertions. More than a third confessed they did not prepare their bodies for the physical demands of their day of DIY. A similar number admitted they weren't used to physical work or were too out of shape for hard graft. Reassuringly, seven in 10 of those surveyed had a first-aid kit and of those did, four out of five had treatments specifically designed for muscle problems or injuries. DIY expert Grant James Crossley said: ‘There may be no escaping DIY and other household chores, but with a little preparation there’s a lot you can do to escape morning-after aches and muscle pain.’ The poll found two in five  people had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes - and men are more likely than women to cut corners . </document> <Summary> A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating.

"<document> Some of the “best” are working to bring down President Donald Trump, yet are they ready to cut to the chase? He has cards up his sleeve. He came to power partly because he won the support of working class and lower middle class whites who were prepared to vote against their economic interest for the sake of the nationalism that Trump espoused. Neither Keir Hardie nor Franklin Roosevelt nor Bernie Sanders were their leader. It was Trump. I don’t find it difficult to imagine how Trump could play the nationalist card that would rally his electorate. The “best” would be against this, but how many would be convinced enough to go out on the street, French style, and demand Congress impeach him? I doubt if the Harvard professors would or journalists from the New York Times, business men, school teachers, doctors, civil servants or airline pilots. Of course, as with the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War protests, there would be students in the front row. Then there would be clergy, a few professors from the University of Wisconsin, novelists, Senator Sanders and at most 50 members of Congress. The police would easily face them down and disperse them. “Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel”, said Samuel Johnson. So is extreme confrontation, or even war. What follows is not my scenario. It is that of Philip Gordon, writing in the current issue of the respected “Foreign Affairs”. He was Barack Obama’s Special Assistant for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf regions. Those who have dormant passionate intensity in their bones should read it and act now before it is too late. Events can move fast. “A week is a long time in politics”, said the former British prime minister, Harold Wilson. Trump could begin his diversionary tactics with Iran, his arch-enemy during the campaign. Gordon says, let’s suppose that a dozen Americans are killed in an attack in Iraq by an Iranian-supported militia. Two days later, Trump imposes further sanctions on Iran, effectively torpedoing the de-nuclearisation agreement negotiated by Obama. Iran continues to test its missiles. It steps up its support for the Syrian government. Later in the year, the situation having deteriorated further, Iran announces it will resume prohibited nuclear activities, including testing advanced centrifuges and expanding its stockpile of low-enrich uranium. Frustrated by continued Iranian support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Pentagon steps up patrols in the Strait of Hormuz and loosens the rules of engagement for U.S. forces. When an Iranian patrol boat aggressively approaches a U.S. cruiser, the ship fires and kills 25 Iranians. Revenge is swift and 6 more American soldiers in Iraq are killed. In return Trump authorises a cruise missile attack on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Nationalist fervour increases in Iran, and also in America. Iran lets its nuclear scientists off the leash. Next, U.S. bombers destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. A good chunk of the U.S. electorate cheers him on. Anti-Trump congressmen feel that they couldn’t continue with their effort to impeach him while America was in such a serious situation. Experts later called the confrontation with China the most dangerous one since the Cuban Missile Crisis that almost erupted into nuclear war. The president’s advisor, Steve Bannon, said at the beginning of the Administration: “We’re going to war in the South China Sea in five to ten years.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, pushed by Trump, warns that China’s access to the islands there “is not going to be allowed”. At the same time North Korea tests another long-range missile capable of reaching the western sea-board of the US. Trump demands that China pressure North Korea to stop the provocation or it would go to war with the North. China is worried about the mass of refugees that would pour into China if the regime collapsed. Also it doesn’t want U.S.-backed troops to advance to its border with the North. It refuses Trump. Trump then says the days of placating China are over. Sanctions are imposed. President Xi Jinping feels he has to retaliate. He imposes a 45% tariff on imports and sells $100 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds. Next follows an incident in the South China Sea, a clash between American and Chinese naval boats. Each side’s carriers are rushed to the region. There is a military stand-off that looks like stretching into the distant future. U.S.-China relations are in ruins. But Trump is off the hook for the rest of his term. During the next election? Perhaps war with North Korea. </document> <Summary> President Donald Trump came to power partly because he won the support of working class and lower middle class whites who were prepared to vote against their economic interest for the sake of the nationalism that Trump espoused.

"<document> (CNN)It wasn't until her 20s that Fethiye Cetin discovered her Armenian ancestry. Her grandmother, 90 years old at the time, told Cetin that her real name was Heranus. Like many other survivors of 1915, Heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden. Many feared a repeat of the horrors they witnessed and barely escaped. In a crowded reception before a memorial concert in Istanbul this week, people rushed to greet Fethiye Cetin. A strong, soft-spoken woman now in her 60s, Cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink. Dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between Turks and Armenians who was tried for ""insulting Turkishness."" He was assassinated in 2007. The shocking discovery of her true heritage would change Cetin's life. She tells Heranus' story in an evocative memoir titled ""My Grandmother."" Heranus and her family were among a massive stream of women and children being forcibly marched by Ottoman soldiers, not knowing where they were going or why they were torn away from their male relatives. Echoing throughout the procession were morbid whispers that the men and teenage boys had all been killed. Heranus was 9 at the time. An officer spotted her and her brother and wanted to take them away. Her mother protested but she was told by others, ""The children are dying one by one. No one will make it out alive from this march. If you give them, their lives will be saved."" Heranus and her brother were scooped up onto the officer's horse and taken to a garden packed with other children and fed the first warm meal they had had in days. But soon reality set in and Heranus began to cry and beg to see her mother. Heranus was separated from her brother, adopted by the officer and his wife, who could not have children of their own. Her name was changed to Seher and she was raised Muslim. And so she survived, had children and grandchildren. Cetin was in law school when her grandmother revealed her secret and painful memories of her Armenian roots. It shattered all that she knew to be real. The 1915 forced deportations and massacres were not taught in Turkey's schools. ""There was a huge silence"" Cetin said. ""It was not just the victims that were silent; it was all of society."" Cetin felt rebellion welling up inside her. ""I wanted to go on the streets and scream that they are lying to us,"" she remembers, ""a cruelty like this happened, and I wanted to shout it out loud."" Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have been doing exactly that and demanding that the ""Great Catastrophe"" be recognized as genocide by Turkey and the world. Armenian President Serzh Sargysan said earlier this year that ""impunity paved a path to Holocaust and genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia and Darfur."" The survivors of 1915 and witnesses remember massacres, bloodied rivers, concentration camps, rape and death marches into the Syrian desert. The Republic of Turkey has always rejected the term ""genocide."" Rather, the Ottoman Empire's Committee of Union and Progress believed Armenian nationalists to be collaborating with the Russian army, which was at war with the Ottoman Empire. To prevent this alliance and stop violence against civilians, the committee undertook a policy of ""relocation"" to move Armenian populations residing in or near the war zone to southern provinces. Turkey argues that wartime conditions, famine and internal conflicts led to the death of millions of Ottomans, including Armenian subjects. But it's only in the last decade that public dialogue in Turkey began. ""We just started breaking the silence recently"", Cetin said. ""People were quiet for 90 years in this country."" Turkish leaders have recently taken a more reconciliatory tone. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered Turkey's condolences last year to the descendants of the Armenians who lost their lives. He called for the establishment of a joint historical commission in order to study the ""events"" of 1915. But Pope Francis' use of the word ""genocide"" and the European Parliament's resolution last week angered Turkish leaders. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the resolution ""selective and one-sided,"" claiming it repeated ""anti-Turkish clichés."" Erdogan deemed it a ""hostile campaign against Turkey."" This week, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu repeated the call for a historical inquiry and the need for an approach based on ""just memory"" for a ""common peaceful future."" He asked that third parties, such as Pope Francis, refrain from ""aggravating age-old wounds."" A century on, Cetin says the dynamism surrounding the 100th anniversary excites her, bringing together artists, musicians, scholars and intellectuals as well as Turkey's citizens of all ethnicities and Armenians from across the world. If the government were to acknowledge 1915 as a genocide, it would speed up the reconciliation and healing process, she says. ""But if it does not face genocide, then it does not matter. Society coming face to face with it is more important."" Still Cetin remains hopeful that Turkey will accept its moral obligation towards history and its people. As an Armenian Turk, Cetin has helped others retrace their roots and look for long lost answers. But for many, the emotional journey remains unfulfilled as long as Turkey denies the cause of their pain. </document> <Summary> It wasn't until her 20s that Fethiye Cetin discovered her Armenian ancestry.
Her grandmother, 90 years old at the time, told Cetin that her real name was Heranus.
Like many other survivors of 1915, Heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden.
Many feared a repeat of the horrors they witnessed and barely escaped. </Summary>"

"<document> England Under 21 captain Jack Butland has revealed voting for team-mate Harry Kane as this season's PFA Young Player of the Year and hopes the Tottenham hotshot can help him emulate goalkeeping skipper Iker Casillas at the European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer. Butland joined his England manager Gareth Southgate and former World Cup legend Michael Owen at St George's Park on St George's Day as around 35 local schoolchildren from the east Midlands were put through their paces by FA skills coaches at England's plush headquarters. The 22-year-old Stoke City goalkeeper is bidding to be the first England captain to lift the European Under 21 championship since Dave Sexton's team won the trophy in 1984 and Kane is expected to be a big part of their team as they attempt to end 31 years of hurt. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has reveled he voted for Harry Kane to win PFA Player of the Year . England U21 captain Jack Butland joined manager Gareth Southgate at St George's Park on Thursday . England U21 boss Southgate demonstrates a drill as 35 local school children were put through their paces . FA chief Greg Dyke has said that Kane's agent had called him to say the Spurs striker wanted to be part of the Three Lions team in June even though he has to go to Australia first for a post-season friendly with his club. On his decision to vote for Kane for the PFA award, Butland said: 'For someone who hadn't previously been given a lot of opportunities, he's been phenomenal. He's come out of nowhere and shown what he's about. 'He has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best I've seen even though he is young. 'For me, there's not a player of the same age near him.' Kane took his tally of goals to 30 for the season with this strike against Newcastle last Sunday . Butland hopes Kane can fire the young Lions to European Championship glory this summer . Butland was part of the ill-fated England side that crashed out of the Under 21 finals at the group stages two years ago, though he did help the Under 17s win their European Championship in 2010. He said: 'With no World Cup or Olympics, it's a chance to grab peoples attention and show there is hope if you like and that there are good players coming through. 'With the incredibly gifted players we have in this country, we need to produce at a higher level. Players like myself, Nathaniel Chalobah and Nathan Redmond experienced tournament football and won it with the Under 17s and that should help massively. Kane has declared that he wants to play in the tournament in the Czech Republic this summer . 'It can bring a calming influence to the group, we will be able to to give a few words of advice here and there and give people an idea of what to expect.' It is unusual for a goalkeeper to be captain but Dino Zoff (1982) and Casillas (2010) led their country to World Cup wins. 'I dreamed of winning the trophy in the last tournament but it didn't go well then. The motivation has been even stronger to produce something this time as a team and do ourselves proud. Butland wants to emulate Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas by captaining his side to tournament glory . 'It has to be the dream, and to lift the trophy would be a huge honour. Casillas has done it, as a Spain captain he has lifted everything. Whether I was captain or not, lifting the trophy would be incredible.' England's squad for the finals will be announced on June 2. Their first match is on June 18. </document> <Summary> England Under 21 captain Jack Butland has revealed voting for team-mate Harry Kane as this season's PFA Young Player of the Year and hopes the Tottenham hotshot can help him emulate goalkeeping skipper Iker Casillas at the European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer.

"<document> Overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best. But it becomes completely believable when it is brought to life through the inspirational, optimistic, comeback story of a charismatic, beautiful, young woman named Belle Gibson. Belle cast a spell through her endearing vulnerability and charming personality, collecting an enormous social media following who were enamoured with her brave account of reclaiming her health. Wellness warrior Belle Gibson has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness . Now that Belle has admitted she made her story up, we ask ourselves, how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle, without a shred of supporting evidence? The answer is very simple. We wanted to believe. And we did not so much believe in Belle´s story, as we believed in Belle. Everyone loves a heart-warming account of overcoming the odds. We were enchanted by Belle´s journey, as well as by Belle herself. A beautiful, young, inspirational woman, we fell in love with her story as well as with her—which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel. Here are five ways that the Belle´s of the world win us over. She founded the Whole Pantry - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded . Appearances are Reality—and Seeing is Believing . Believe it or not, studies show that people cannot distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive. This causes us to make the easier judgement—that other people are truthful. To make matters worse, when we like someone, we are likely to believe they are truthful, even when they are lying. How do we overcome the truthfulness bias? One way is to closely examine a person´s motives. When someone relays a heart-warming story, as Belle did, what is she getting out of it? While many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion, examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light. Wendy L. Patrick PhD says we fell for Belle Gibson because 'we love heartwarming stories—especially comeback stories' Born to Bond - There is a Bit of Belle in All of Us . We love heart-warming stories—especially comeback stories. Especially when we feel an affinity to the heroine. We were Belle´s cheerleaders as she recounted her fight against cancer—using a weapon we all have at our disposal: healthy eating. Every one of us could be Belle in the future, because cancer strikes without warning. We loved walking along side her in her journey, recognizing there is a bit of Belle in all of us. We identified with her vulnerability, celebrated her success in regaining her health, and felt empowered by the recognition that although we each face different hurdles, if she could beat the odds, so can we. 'We loved walking along side her in her journey, recognizing there is a bit of Belle in all of us' Credibility Clouds Perception: Failing to Heed Belle´s Alarm Bells . Credible people are welcome sources of security. We feel comfortable following their lead, and taking their advice. Belle released a whole foods recipe book and top-rating food app, which thousands of people bought. Why? Because she was a certified nutritionist? Because the medical community validated her recipes? Nope. Simply because we liked her, and therefore viewed her as credible. When we view someone as credible, we rely on their guidance and believe what they say. Unfortunately, this blind trust can create emotional blinders that cause us to miss, misinterpret, or discount red flags. Credibility is not a speaker trait, but a perception created in an audience. Credible, likeable, well-spoken communicators are believed to possess a wide range of positive traits including reliability, trustworthiness, goodwill, and expertise. Believe it or not, we also view such people as an authority, even when we do not have any personal knowledge of their credentials. Wendy L Patrick is the author of RED FLAGS: How to Spot Frenemies, Underminers, and Toxic People . The Power of Attraction—the Halo Effect . Belle Gibson is an attractive young woman with an endearing personality. We can´t help but smile as we watch the video footage documenting her journey, including her hopes, dreams, and bright plans for the future. Belle´s emotional appeal stems from the halo effect—where we tend to clothe attractive, likeable people with a host of other positive characteristics that they do not have. These characteristics include trustworthiness and honesty. 'Once we form a positive impression of another person, good luck trying to change our mind' Trading Rose Colored Glasses for Reading Glasses . Once we form a positive impression of another person, good luck trying to change our mind. We are incredibly resistant to negative information that threatens an emotionally pleasing positive impression we have of someone we have grown to like, respect, or admire. So many people fell in love with Belle´s approachable, endearing, likeable persona, they were fanatical in their support of her straightforward, simple, healthy strategy of battling one of the world´s deadliest conditions. The lesson here? The next time you hear a seemingly unbelievable story narrated by an attractive, emotional pleasing storyteller, trade in your rose colored classes for reading glasses, to ensure that you can and should believe what you see. Dr. Patrick's book outlines how to spot 'emotional blinders' and what red flags to pay attention to .

"<document> Speaker 2: Yeah. Item number 12, communication for Mayor Robert Garcia. Recommendation to receive and file a report from the mayor on the city's involvement in the Long Beach College promise.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Just briefly, I know we have a long night. I just wanted to check in with the council and obviously let them know that the city has been working actively working with our education partners on the Long Beach College promise.
Speaker 1: There has been a lot of interest. Education, as most know, is at the top of the priority list of issues that I'm pursuing and ensuring that we are working with our school district as much as possible. With us today, we do have two of our school board members.
Speaker 1: I see Dr. Feld Williams is in the audience, as is Megan Kerr. I know that Chris Steinhauser is at another meeting. He was going to try to swing by. I'm not sure if he'll be able to make it or not.
Speaker 1: But I want to just say that the city has been active and becoming a full partner as part of the college promise, which we all know, which is very exciting. I also want everyone to know that the college promise continues to be a national model.
Speaker 1: Recently, a members of the heads of all of our institutions were in Washington, D.C., receiving awards and and accolades about the success of our Long Beach program. And what we're excited about here in Long Beach is not just supporting the current work the College Promise does, which is clearly focused on student success, which is focused on retention
Speaker 1: , which is focus on ensuring that Long Beach Unified School students have access to a community college or a Cal State University education. But we're also focused on ensuring that those institutions have a support from the city. In addition to that, we had discussions with all of our university and school school partners about additional goals as part of
Speaker 1: the college promise. One of them is a goal of trying to trying to attain universal preschool enrollment for Long Beach. We all know that research shows that there's no better investment than a preschool education for young for young people.
Speaker 1: And we want to ensure that every family in Long Beach, regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live, have access to preschool. In addition, as we all know, when a family is able to enroll a young child in preschool, the family also has the ability then to have child care and then possibly go to work or
Speaker 1: pick up that second job or work with other members of their family and spend time. So it really is an economic benefit as well. The second major initiative, which we're all working on very aggressively, is to double the amount of internships in the city for Long Beach High School and college students.
Speaker 1: We are actively pursuing this goal. We think we will be able to double them in this first year, hopefully, certainly by the first or second year. But our goal is this first year. And that is something that the unit that the university, the community college and Lambert Unified are all actively, actively working on.
Speaker 1: And so we're incredibly excited about this process. We expect that sometime in the spring, we'll be able to come to the council with a very detailed report on on how everything is moving forward. And tonight, there's two items on the agenda tonight.
Speaker 1: So this so this item is just a a brief report that I wanted to give. And then there's a second item, which is actually the city council passing a resolution in support of the promise. And so with that, I want to get a motion to first receive and filed this report.
Speaker 1: Is there any public comment on this report? KC Nunn I'd like to ask. I know there's some members queued up. Did you all want to wait for the second item to speak? Okay, so why don't we do that?
Speaker 1: Is that's the resolution? And I also am going to call up r our two school board members at the start of the next item for public comment. And so with that, if we can get a motion, we can cast their votes for the receive and file item before we move on to the resolution.
Speaker 2: Motion carries six zero.

Thank you. Just briefly, I know we have a long night. I just wanted to check in with the council and obviously let them know that the city has been working actively working with our education partners on the Long Beach College promise.
There has been a lot of interest. Education, as most know, is at the top of the priority list of issues that I'm pursuing and ensuring that we are working with our school district as much as possible. With us today, we do have two of our school board members.
I see Dr. Feld Williams is in the audience, as is Megan Kerr. I know that Chris Steinhauser is at another meeting. He was going to try to swing by. I'm not sure if he'll be able to make it or not.
Recently, a members of the heads of all of our institutions were in Washington, D.C., receiving awards and and accolades about the success of our Long Beach program. And what we're excited about here in Long Beach is not just supporting the current work the College Promise does, which is clearly focused on student success, which is focused on retention
, which is focus on ensuring that Long Beach Unified School students have access to a community college or a Cal State University education. But we're also focused on ensuring that those institutions have a support from the city. In addition to that, we had discussions with all of our university and school school partners about additional goals as part of
the college promise. One of them is a goal of trying to trying to attain universal preschool enrollment for Long Beach. We all know that research shows that there's no better investment than a preschool education for young for young people.
And we want to ensure that every family in Long Beach, regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live, have access to preschool. In addition, as we all know, when a family is able to enroll a young child in preschool, the family also has the ability then to have child care and then possibly go to work or
pick up that second job or work with other members of their family and spend time. So it really is an economic benefit as well. The second major initiative, which we're all working on very aggressively, is to double the amount of internships in the city for Long Beach High School and college students.
We are actively pursuing this goal. We think we will be able to double them in this first year, hopefully, certainly by the first or second year. But our goal is this first year. And that is something that the unit that the university, the community college and Lambert Unified are all actively, actively working on.
And so we're incredibly excited about this process. We expect that sometime in the spring, we'll be able to come to the council with a very detailed report on on how everything is moving forward. And tonight, there's two items on the agenda tonight.
So this so this item is just a a brief report that I wanted to give. And then there's a second item, which is actually the city council passing a resolution in support of the promise. And so with that, I want to get a motion to first receive and filed this report.
Is there any public comment on this report? KC Nunn I'd like to ask. I know there's some members queued up. Did you all want to wait for the second item to speak? Okay, so why don't we do that?
Is that's the resolution? And I also am going to call up r our two school board members at the start of the next item for public comment. And so with that, if we can get a motion, we can cast their votes for the receive and file item before we move on to the resolution.
Motion carries six zero. </Summary>"

"<document> Just a few years ago, Lockheed Martin was working to build a pilot plant to demonstrate a renewable energy technology called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) near the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The company wanted to get funding from the U.S. Navy for the pioneering project and to cable the electricity it produced straight to the naval base at Pearl Harbor.¶ Now Lockheed is designing that 10-megawatt pilot plant—but not in American waters. Instead, the facility will be off the coast of southern China, and Lockheed’s customer is a private Chinese company that develops resorts and luxury housing.¶ Over the years Lockheed has approached various potential partners, says Rob Varley, the company’s OTEC project manager. Building an offshore energy station at commercial scale is an expensive proposition, particularly when it’s the first time the technology is being tried out. Lockheed won’t release the cost of the project, but outside experts estimate that a 10-MW facility would cost roughly US $300 million to $500 million. However, experts say that a full-scale 100-MW plant would be more competitive at just $1.2 billion.¶ “The biggest challenge has been to get the gold and start the project,” says Varley, but in terms of engineering, he says, “I don’t see any showstoppers at this point.”¶ That’s not surprising, since the company has been working on OTEC since the 1970s, and the technology hasn’t changed drastically since then. OTEC systems make use of the temperature differential in tropical areas between warm surface water and cold deep water. In most systems, ammonia, which has a very low boiling point, passes through a heat exchanger containing the warm water. The ammonia is vaporized and used to turn a turbine, and then it’s cycled past the cold water to recondense. This is a renewable energy technology with the rare capacity to supply base-load power, as water temperatures are fairly stable.¶ The ammonia passes through a closed loop, while the water comes and goes through massive pipes. The project in China may pump cold water up from a depth of about 1000 meters, using a pipe that’s 4 meters across. Varley says that some of the infrastructure can be borrowed from the offshore drilling industry: “We showed them our requirements for the platform, and they yawned and said, ‘Is that all you got?’ ” he says. “But then we showed them the pipe.” Attaching the massive pipe to a relatively small floating platform creates unusual stresses, Varley says. Lockheed also had to find materials for the pipes and the heat exchangers that could withstand the harsh marine environment.¶ Lockheed’s client is Reignwood Group, a Chinese company whose diverse portfolio includes resort and housing developments. According to a company press release, Reignwood Group wants the 10-MW plant to supply all the power for a large-scale environmentally sound resort community that the company will build in southern China. A Reignwood spokesperson did not respond to requests for more details by press time. A Lockheed spokesperson says the companies are currently working on site selection and that they’ll start designing a facility this year to suit the specific conditions at that site.¶ The China project isn’t the only OTEC project going ahead. Baltimore-basedOTEC International is negotiating the terms of a 1-MW demonstration plant in Hawaii, and the company is planning much bigger facilities in Hawaii and the Caribbean. Both OTEC International and Lockheed Martin see their current plans as steps toward a much more ambitious goal: utility-scale OTEC plants. “Going from a PowerPoint to a 100-MW would be too big a leap,” says Lockheed’s Varley. OTEC advocates have been trying to build megawatt-scale facilities for decades, but several ambitious projects have failed to materialize. So why should it be different this decade? Eileen O’Rourke, president of OTEC International, says there’s a convergence of favorable conditions. “Island jurisdictions like Hawaii have very high energy prices and limited alternatives for base-load power, and OTEC fits with their desire to be energy independent and green,” she says. Add in mature technology from the offshore oil industry, she says, and “we just think the time is right for OTEC.” </document> <Summary> Just a few years ago, Lockheed Martin was working to build a pilot plant to demonstrate a renewable energy technology called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) near the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

"<document> Second, key strands of the LIO concept suffer serious theoretical weaknesses. For example, one strand argues that a powerful state can bind itself to institutions, thereby reassuring weaker partners that it will meet its alliance commitments, neither abandoning its allies nor using force coercively against them; such reassurance was essential to NATO's success during the Cold War. A powerful state, however, cannot effectively constrain its ability to use its power/military force when the stakes are sufficiently high. Another strand of the LIO concept holds that hierarchy built on legitimate authority, granted by subordinate (i.e., weaker) states to the dominant (i.e., stronger) state, is essential to explaining cooperation under anarchy. According to this argument, hierarchy plays a central role in explaining cooperation among NATO's member states. I show, however, that this has not been the case and that established theories of alliance cooperation explain cooperation within NATO quite well. Given these theoretical weaknesses, the LIO concept cannot support claims that the LIO's institutions have been more effective or better able to weather shocks from the international system than they would have been otherwise. </document> <Summary> Second, key strands of the LIO concept suffer serious theoretical weaknesses.

"<document> Thierry Henry said the Stadium of Light was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during Sunderland’s derby win over Newcastle. Six days later, silence reigned. A sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of Crystal Palace’s fourth goal inside 14 second-half minutes. Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment following defeat . A shameful silence as Sunderland’s players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse. But perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from Dick Advocaat. When asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop, he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning: ‘Worried? Yes, very worried.’ And he has every reason to be. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat looks on as Sunderland are dismantled at home by Crystal Palace . The stands emptied during the second-half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals . Exactly four weeks earlier Advocaat had watched from the comfort of his home in Holland as Sunderland trailed 4-0 at half-time to Aston Villa, a side who had scored just twice on the road all season. On Saturday, he watched from the discomfort of the touchline as Yannick Bolasie trebled his tally for the campaign with a devastating 11-minute hat-trick. The Congolese forward had earlier laid on the opener for Glenn Murray. Palace were ruthless and Alan Pardew, beaten in his last four Tyne-Wear derbies as Newcastle boss, had his revenge. Yannick Bolasie applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping Crystal Palace to victory . Sunderland (4-3-3): Pantilimon 4.5; Jones 5, Vergini 4, O’Shea 3.5, Van Aanholt 5; Rodwell 5, Cattermole 4.5 (Bridcutt 64min, 5), Gomez 4.5 (Johnson 60, 5); Defoe 5, Fletcher 5, Wickham 6. Subs not used: Reveillere, Graham, Coates, Mannone, Buckley. Scorer: Wickham 89. Booked: Rodwell, Cattermole. Crystal Palace (4-4-2): Speroni 6; Ward 6, Dann 7.5, Delaney 6.5, Souare 6 (Kelly 35, 6); Zaha 7.5, McArthur 6.5 (Ledley 69, 6), Jedinak 6.5, Puncheon 7; Bolasie 9 (Sanogo 71, 6), Murray 8. Subs not used: Hangeland, Hennessey, Gayle, Ameobi. Scorers: Murray 48, Bolasie 51, 54, 62. Booked: Dann. Man of the match: Yannick Bolasie. Referee: Anthony Taylor 6. SUPER STAT: Sunderland have now lost the four matches immediately after their Tyne-Wear derby victories. Sunderland, though, had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match. When your skipper, John O’Shea, is out-fought for a ball with the odds stacked in his favour — as he was for Bolasie’s second — then you know your problems have permeated the core of the team. Jermain Defoe, derby match winner the previous weekend, played as if he had been issued with an exclusion order from the penalty box. Advocaat said: ‘I can see for myself that we don’t create enough chances even though we play with three strikers. Even when we play with so many up front we don’t create anything and that means there is something wrong in the squad. ‘We showed we can do something against Newcastle but if we carry on performing like this then we have no chance.’ On this evidence, Advocaat is right. Sunderland will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others. They are not capable of saving themselves, as they did in miraculous fashion 12 months ago. Given that the season finishes with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea they are now working on a four-game rescue plan. Wilfired Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie (left) after the forward produced a stunning hat-trick in the second-half . For Palace and brilliant Bolasie, meanwhile, they are only looking up after four straight wins. And the 25-year-old credited Pardew following his first senior hat-trick. ‘That (goals) is what the manager has been demanding from me,’ he said. ‘He has been putting me right in the middle of sessions, even doing the lay-ups for me. Crystal Palace forward Zaha evades the attention of Sunderland striker Fletcher during the contest . ‘He has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers, it’s been excellent.’ Pardew enjoyed seeing his side run riot. Murray headed them in front before Bolasie executed three swift breakaways. A league table from Pardew’s time in charge has Palace fifth. And he added: ‘We are a pretty young team and only need to add two or three to the squad and we could be a real force next season.’ As for next season for Sunderland, they can only hope they’re in the same division as Palace. Advocaat shakes hands with opposition manager Alan Pardew knowing his side is in real relegation danger . </document> <Summary> Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment following defeat.

"<document> #Person1#: Excuse me, I'd like to buy a guitar. Could you recommend one?
#Person2#: Sure. Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one?
#Person1#: An acoustic one.
#Person2#: Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical?
#Person1#: What's the difference?
#Person2#: Well, a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar's. It's best suited for finger picking. A steel-string is best for playing chords.
#Person1#: I'm mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar.
#Person2#: In that case, I'd suggest a steel-string guitar. The best one we have is the Ovation.
#Person1#: This one's a little too expensive for me. I'd prefer something cheaper for now. When I'Ve learned to play, I might get a better one.
#Person2#: In that case, how about this one? It's inexpensive but it's still well made and easy to play.

"<document> Sachin Tendulkar has paid tribute to a 'promising' Indian cricketer who has died after colliding with a team-mate while attempting to take a catch during a club match in Kolkata. The Board of Control for Cricket In India confirmed on their official Twitter account that 20-year-old Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering 'a cardiac arrest following on-field injury'. According to reports, Keshri colleded with a team-mate as they both attempted to take a catch in a senior one-day match match in Kolkata on Friday, and though he regained consciousness afterwards, he died in hospital on Monday. Keshri was only playing as a substitute fielder having been the 12th man. Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest following an on-field injury in Kolkata . Former national team captain Tendulkar, the highest runscorer in Test and one-day international history, was among several India stars to offer their condolences at the news. Tendulkar tweeted: 'Saddened by the demise of Ankit Keshri. A promising career aborted by an unfortunate incident on field. 'May God give strength to Ankit's family and friends to cope with this loss #RIP' Current India batsman Ajinkya Rahane said: 'Very sad to know about Ankit Keshri. Strength to his family and friends. RIP.' Manoj Tiwary, who has played nine ODIs for India, wrote: 'I'm shocked 2 hear d news of Under-19 player from bengal named Ankit kesri's demise due to heart attack. My deepest condolences goes out 2 Ankit kesri's family nd frnds. 'A promising player who scored loads of runs at under 19 level nd he wud hav surely played 4 senior bengal in 2 years time.

Keshri was considered an up-and-coming talent on the Indian cricket scene. The right-hander was captain of the Bengal Under-19 team, and was short-listed for India's under-19 team for the 2014 Colts World Cup. 'It's so unfortunate,' said the Bengal cricket association's Subir Ganguly. 'He was such a promising cricketer and for him to pass away in such a manner is difficult to swallow.'

As folks may recall a couple of years ago when they started development on that project, they are to an agreement with the building across the street from
Speaker 2: the Western Building, which is hosts a bunch of computer facilities there or data warehouse. And the agreement was that they would capture the heat that is put off in the computers, heat, water, bring the water across the street to their facilities and use that waste heat from the computers to heat those buildings.
Speaker 2: That project has been moving forward very successfully. This ordinance today would allow them to expand across a couple of streets to future parcels they're planning to develop and use that same waste heat to heat additional buildings.

"<document> Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker. Raiola, steeped in Italian and Dutch football, is one of the most influential agents in the game, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli among his high-profile clients. The Italian middleman has been involved in transfer deals worth over £400million and Lukaku’s decision to sever his links with Christophe Henrotay, who oversaw his Everton club record £28m move from Chelsea last summer, adds a possible new dimension to his career. Romelu Lukaku (left) poses alongside his new agent Mino Raiola in an Instagram picture . The appointment of Raiola as agent fuels speculation Lukaku (left) could be set for a move away from Everton . Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, is unconcerned by Lukaku joining Raiola . The Belgium striker, 21, has scored only eight times in the Premier League so far this season compared with 15 last term. But he has netted 18 in total, including eight in the Europa League which spearheaded Everton’s run to the last 16. With Everton 13th in the Barclays Premier League there will be no European adventure next season but Martinez, who persuaded Lukaku to turn a season-long loan into a permanent five-year deal last summer, is adamant that the player’s switch of agents has not set the alarm bells ringing. Martinez said: ‘He has changed his agent, yes, but we are not concerned, no. Rom is entitled to do that. ‘Everyone speaks about the colourful character that Mino Raiola is but he has a lot of players who are very much people who are happy to stay at one club. ‘I dealt with Mino Raiola at Wigan and not many people know that he had Danny de Ridder or Vladimir Weiss, players who have been happy to stay at a club. I don’t think there is anything to read into that.’ Martinez does not expect a summer of upheaval at Goodison Park, despite the team’s disappointing campaign. Veteran defender Sylvain Distin, 37, who has not featured in the league since late December, will leave at the end of his contract but, according to Martinez, fellow centre back Antolin Alcaraz still has a chance to earn a new deal during the closing weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the manager insists 21-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley can build on his performances from the bench for England against Lithuania and Italy to finish an indifferent season on a high. ‘He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season,’ added Martinez, whose side entertain Southampton on Saturday. Raiola has engineered big money moves for players such as Mario Balotelli at Liverpool . Martinez believes that Ross Barkley (left) will benefit from the difficult season that he has endured . ‘This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. ‘He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. ‘He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don’t see many players in world football with those capabilities. ‘We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.’ </document> <Summary> Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker.

We already know that many white Americans have felt threatened by different minority groups across American history (Tichenor 2002, Olzak 1992). What is impressive is just how wide ranging those effects remain today and how the presence of different minority groups can heighten or diminish those effects. In a political era, in which many claim that the significance of race has faded, we find that Latino or immigrant related views impact the political orientation of many members of the white population. Party identification – the most influential variable in American politics – is at least in part a function of the way individual white Americans see Latinos and immigrants. So too is the vote in national contests for President and Congress.

"<document> Speaker 0: All right. Thank you. Do a recap. Under resolutions, no items have been called out under bills for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. Council Member Cunneen has called out Bill 818 for comments under pending.
Speaker 0: No items have been called out. Madam Secretary, please put the first item on our screens. All right, we've got it up. Council member each. Please go ahead with your comments.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Council President Gilmore And this bill is an extension of a current executive order we have that protects workers who are doing essential services on city property for things like janitorial, security, etc. to be able to keep their jobs if the contractor they work for changes over as the city periodically rebuilds that work.
Speaker 7: But it also expands those protections to essential workers in more categories, particularly many of the workers at our airport who do baggage or clean aircrafts or push passengers with disabilities. So all of those workers who really we rely on and we came to understand during this pandemic how essential they really are.
Speaker 7: They showed up to work when they needed to to keep things running, or many of them lost jobs, as we, you know, dialed down the amount of service we needed in buildings. So in many ways, they were impacted in both ways.
Speaker 7: These protections are common sense. They are efficient. They help to make sure that we keep the security protocols high and that our city runs efficiently. They're good for businesses because you kind of have a ready made workforce when you start over rather than losing people who want to find new jobs before their contract turns over.
Speaker 7: We talked about it at length at committee, but I wanted to call it out because I think for me personally, this bill is a sign not only of this council's commitment that the airport and the mayor's office and all the administrative agencies who partner with us to look at all the details.
Speaker 7: But it's our city's commitment that the important benefits of the airport and the important benefits really do need to flow to everyone. I know we talk a lot about gentrification on this council and we talk about it in the housing sphere.
Speaker 7: And, you know, really the truth is that a good paying job that you can keep is also an anti gentrification or displacement force. At one point, the airport found that at least about a quarter of the folks who worked at the airport lived in Denver.
Speaker 7: We know that we're an employer for the entire region and that's a good thing. You know, it's good that we have enough jobs for residents of many communities. But if you think about it, those workers, many of them who live in far northeast Denver, many of them who live in west Denver, they are in their neighborhoods facing
Speaker 7: those rising housing costs, facing all the other challenges we talk about. And their ability to keep their jobs sustainably is linked to their ability to stay in our city, too. And so I believe that if we're going to be comprehensive, right, in thinking about our airport as an economic agenda or engine, that these policies that make sure
Speaker 7: that the jobs, first of all, are good jobs. Right. With the wages we described. Second of all, are sustainable jobs with policies like worker retention. And then third of all are just jobs. Right. That they have good voices on the job, are not fired for organizing or for being engaged in activities that are protected, that those types
Speaker 7: of things are what make that economic engine valuable to the regular people of Denver who may not be frequent fliers. Right. It's valuable to all of us as passengers. But that economic engine piece has to mean something to the workers at all incomes.
Speaker 7: And so I think this completes the vision. Right, these types of policies that we've been addressing. And so I want to thank the workers who came to testify during committee, the staff and the folks who represent them from Unite Here and SEIU Local 105 And I share this with my colleagues at committee.
Speaker 7: But, you know, this is a union neutral policy. The majority of workers who are protected by it probably aren't represented by a union. But these are policies that really fill in those gaps for all of those workers and make sure that they're on a level playing field.
Speaker 7: And so for that, I'm really proud that it's on the consent agenda tonight. There will be no dramatic vote count here, but I thought it was important because of what these workers have been through over the last year, because of how really collaborative and meaningful this conversation was, where all the players in our city agencies and council
Speaker 7: members and workers where we're working together. I want to thank the airlines who participated in the conversation and gave us feedback that resulted in some changes, but I just thought it was worthy of comment before we passed it along in the consent agenda, I want to thank my colleagues for their support, especially you, President Gilmore, as the
Speaker 7: host of our airport, been very engaged in the conversation. So thank you to all and look forward to the consent vote.
Speaker 0: All right. Thank you very much, Councilmember Kinney, and likewise, want to thank the folks that are working at it, Dan, and the leadership at the airport as well. But then also, I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for your leadership and partnership, especially in working with Unite Here and SEIU as well, and so happy to
Speaker 0: support this tonight. It's important and it stabilizes our families in the community and also the airport as well. All right. Not seen any other items called out. That concludes that recap portion. All bills for introduction are ordered published.

"<document> Laos is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful scenery and ornate temples, however not many people venture below the surface and discover that what is underground is perhaps even more spectacular. The wondrous Tham Khoun Ex caves are so exquisite they don't look real at first, which is perhaps why locals believe that spirits inhabit the underground wonderland. Cave photographer, John Spies, 59, captured the sheer magnificence of the vast, yet intricate, underground wonderland. Enormous banks of terraced flowstone decorate the walls of the cave in many places. This slowly growing mound of white and orange calcite is one of the larger deposits along the river passage . Rippling reflections: A blue-tinted glow from outside illuminates the entrance chamber of the cave . Not your usual day out! Floating on clear deep water and reflections near the cave entrance, visitors can either bring their own kayaks or rent boats from the local community to paddle deep inside the cave and marvel at its wonders . Tham Khoun Ex caves, commonly known as Xe Bang Fai River caves, feature imposing stalagmitemade of mineral deposits. With over 15km (nine miles) of awe-inspiring passages and wide expanses of water, it really is one of Laos' hidden treasures. There is even a vibrant forest thriving at the upstream entrance to the caves, the lush green colour contrasting with the  enormous white and orange banks of terraces flowstone that decorates the walls. Visitors are able to kayak through the waters, or explore adjacent chambers on foot. The cave is only able to be safely accessed during the dry season from November to April and during this time the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue. For some of the grander shots, a team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies helped to light-paint this enormous cavern for this long exposure shot. In 2008, an expedition, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack lead to the mysterious  caves being mapped and photographed for the first time. What the explorers discovered about the little-known cavern was a vast river cave, which means a cavern with an active water source flowing through it. 'Everything about the cave is big-from its towering entrances to its phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10inches across,' Pollack told National Geographic. Nature at its best! The upstream inflow entrance of Tham Khoun Xe has a verdant forest inside a huge collapsed doline. It is possible to kayak from the resurgence to here and back in one full day . Hidden secrets! Massive formations abound in a newly discovered fossil section of the cave, 50 metres above the river level. This section, encrusted with delicate formations and not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances on . Gigantic! The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 60 metres long and is probably one of the worldís largest rimstone basins . American cave explorer Dave Pierce marvels at giant cave pearls which grow like pearls in an oyster with concentric layers of calcite slowly building up year after year . Lit up! The subterranean passage of the river is spectacularly decorated with calcified formations . Heading into darkness, a visitor paddles a small canoe near the downstream entrance. In the dry season from November to April, the only part of the year safe to visit the cave, the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue . This gigantic section, is also not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances . The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 196 feet long and is probably one of the world's largest rimstone basins. The pool is filled with water during the wet season. The rims of basins like this grow taller each year as calcite precipitates from cave water as it flows faster over protrusions . The immense proportions of Tham Khuon Xe, one of the worldís greatest river caves, are difficult to photograph. A team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies managed to light-paint this enormous section for this long exposure shot .

The underground Tham Khoun Xe caves are even more spectacular but less visited.
Photographer John Spies captured the vast, intricate caves, decorated with enormous terraced stalagmites.
The 9 mile long cave has water sections for kayaking and adjacent chambers to explore.
The caves are only safely accessed November-April when the water is clear and deep green.
In 2008 the cave was first mapped and photographed, revealing a huge cavern with towering entrances and large spiders.
Sections have lush forest and are untouched by tourists.
To photograph the caves, a team used powerful lights for long exposures.
Explorer John Pollack said everything about the cave is big. </Summary>"

Speaker 4: The committee recommends the City Council.
Speaker 1: Pass the bill.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Suarez, as chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to provide the committee report.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So the Seattle Repertory Theater, like the rest of Seattle's arts community is facing, has faced severe economic challenges as they will be unable to hold in-person performances until the governor's restrictions are lifted to address the challenges caused by the pandemic.
Speaker 2: This proposed Third Amendment to the 1996 agreement would remove the obligation for the Seattle Repertory Theater to make their 2019 and 2020 fiscal year contributions to the fund. The 2019 Fund is 170,000 $571,000. And that 220,000. Fiscal year contribution is 174 836,000.
Speaker 2: So since they're not since they're unable to make that contribution to the fund, we want to move to make sure that we can allow them to use the fund for operating expenses through July through June, I'm sorry, 30th, 2022.
Speaker 2: I will clarify why 2019 is listed. While COVID struck beginning of 2020. The 2019 fiscal year contributions to the fund were due June 2020. But because of the pandemic, the schedule was not met. So basically the obligation for the Seattle Repertory Theater to make these donation.
Speaker 2: I'm not donations. These contributions couldn't be done in light of COVID. The SEAL Repertory Theater would be required to maintain a minimum balance of $160,000 in the fund. The fund, which is owned and managed by the Seattle Repertory Theater and per the 1996 agreement was to have been used solely for replacement, maintenance and repair purposes of the
Speaker 2: Bagley Rite Theater. The Salem Repertory Theater was founded in 1963 under the leadership of Bagley. Right. It is one of the oldest resident organizations on the Seattle Center campus. So the after our committee hearing last week, the Public Assets and Native Keys Committee would recommend that council pass council bill 119964.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Governor Juarez. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Oh, there we go. Yes. Memorable, please.

I just want to express my thanks and appreciation, as I did in Committee to Seattle Center for working to address the dire needs of our arts organizations in this really difficult time and really appreciate sort of understanding that the the efforts of the city to to meet those needs will not have a negative
Speaker 4: impact on the ability of the theater to address maintenance needs, but will put the theater on better footing for when they are aiming to reopen. So thanks to Director Dellums for.
Speaker 1: His and his staff's work on this.

"<document> If we accept biospherical egalitarianism, then humans should be treated in no special way; humans are not to be set part from nature. But by arguing that natural states occur only when an ecosystem is left untouched by humans, Naess and others are implicitly separating humans from nature. What human do turns out to be unnatural. Hence, there is an internal inconsistency. Further, all human actions must be seen as natural -- including environmentally destructive ones. Only then do we have humans as being intimately part of nature. Watson then asks: Should we not, though, halt our environmentally destructive behaviour? Yes, he answers, but only because it is in our best interests to do so. Clearly, then, we have reduced the outlook back to anthropocentrism. Human beings ought to curb their evolutionary tendencies, rather than let them flow as Naess and others argue, because we have such a great potential for being destructive. The fact that only human behaviour is subject to moral evaluation does set us apart. If we really are merely members of the biotic community, then surely egalitarianism implies that we ought not to be treated differently. But most non-anthropocentric ethical systems prescribe constraints only on human conduct. </document> <Summary> If we accept biospherical egalitarianism, then humans should be treated in no special way; humans are not to be set apart from nature.

"<document> Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers lay bare the film star's 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride during their short-lived marriage. Chaplin's union to Lita Grey, who was nearly 20 years his junior, lasted just three years. The iconic film star was said have bedded the impressionable 16-year-old after promising her marriage and then tried to convince her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant. On the pairs wedding night Chaplin was also said to have confided in friends that the union was a better prospect than prison. An original copy of the couples 50-page divorce papers was set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when it goes under the hammer, after being found in America. The 50-page divorce papers of Charlie Chaplin and his second wife Lita Grey were found in a bank in America . Charlie Chaplin, left, married second wife Lita Grey, right, who was nearly 20 years his jounior, in 1924 and the union lasted for just three years . The divorce papers are set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when they go under the hammer in Plymouth . Chaplin, then 35, married his second wife Lita, 16, in 1924. They divorced just three years later with the teenager lifting the lid on their marriage. In the papers it was alleged that Chaplin slept with the 'virtuous and inexperienced' Lita when she was barely 16 after promising to marry her. On their wedding night Chaplin was said to have told friends that the marriage was a better option than prison. He said to Lita: 'This marriage won't last long, I will make you so damn sick of me that you won't want to live with me.' Another part claims Chaplin delayed marrying Lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or 'criminal operation'. And the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a 'gold digger' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made, one sent to Chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks, involved in the proceedings. The papers for sale in Devon, were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Almost a century later they are being sold by Parade Antiques on Plymouth for £15,000. The papers for sale were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927 . Lita claimed that she endured 'cruel and inhumane' treatment by Chaplin in the legal papers . John Cabello, who owns the antiques shop, said: 'We got it from a person in America - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them. 'He was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead. 'When the papers were published, Chaplin was ostracised for a while. People in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work. 'All this comes out and makes for quite hard reading, even by today's standards.' Rob Morrish, 27, who runs the shop's website, poured over the historic legal documents. The 27-year-old said: 'About a week's worth of work went into researching the document, reading through it took some time. 'It's all hand signed and very old and fragile. It was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling.' The papers reveal intimate details of the couples unstable relationship, believed to be an attempt by Lita's lawyers to tarnish Chaplin's reputation and gain a bigger settlement. Mr Morrish said: 'They met on set of one of his films and he seduced her as a young woman. It was frowned upon but he tried to make the most of the situation. 'When she became pregnant he wasn't particularly pleased to be trapped in a marriage. 'He squirrelled her away and did not report the birth until months later to make it look like the child was conceived after they wedded. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings . Lita was granted a $800,000 settlement when the couple eventually divorced in 1927 . 'She was quite a young woman when they divorced and she was being sent by her lawyers to get as much as they could. She has said she regretted it in later life. 'It was way above and beyond what is standard for divorce proceedings, even for now.' Eventually in 1927, Lita and Chaplin divorced and she was granted a settlement of $800,000, the largest at the time. Mr Morrish said: 'She achieved what her lawyers wanted. In the end she got what she wanted but he still had a fantastic career after that.' </document> <Summary> Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers reveal his 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride, Lita Grey, during their short-lived marriage.

"<document> Honesty compels us to admit, then, that we have been living in a classic ordeal, a classic test of initiation. We have had no choice; yet we may now turn this necessity into a virtue. For if our goal is to build and attain a new level on which to live, we must put ourselves into such an initiatory situation. Every transition to a new spiritual level demands the death of the old. For every higher level is a level of wider integration and greater wholeness, leaving behind a level of relative fragmentation. Thus we must allow ourselves to experience a dissolution of the parts of our lives, so that a new synthesis can be created. Certainly this must be true if wholeness is the meaning of the fourth level. And only in a direct confrontation with death can such a dissolution and merger be experienced. This is the evidence of religious traditions throughout the world. If we want to build a fourth level, we must accept and even embrace our initiatory experience as something positive. Of course we must also recognize that we have not completed the process; our three decade initiatory chaos is still upon us, and only we ourselves can choose to complete the process. Nevertheless, we are en route, and it is the Bomb itself that has made this possible. Our initiations must be in some sense individual and private, but they must also be done in community; society as a whole must undergo the experience. Hence we can learn our path not only from the myth of the individual hero but also from the myth of the heroic rebirth of whole peoples, even of the whole world. Indeed we have such a myth, kept alive for us by the Bomb, in the tradition of the apocalypse. We can learn something valuable from this tradition too. We can learn that our initiation must be acted out in real history—in the empirical reality of the political, social, and cultural world. And we can learn that no matter how bad things may be now, they must get worse before they get better. ‘The chaos of today must be intensified; death must be given Its full due before new life can begin. We must face more honestly and more deeply the distortions in our lives—the insecurity of a fragmented and chaotic world whose survival hangs on such a slim thread. In doing so, we must admit that we feel ourselves living in desperate times and immersed to   some degree or other in feelings of despair. Joanna Rogers Macy has written eloquently on this subject, showing how our numbing leads us to repress the despair that must arise from an honest assessment of our situation: “This refusal of feeling takes a heavy toll The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative uses.”2 Macy suggests that we must allow ourselves to feel this despair if our life energy is to be freed again; this opening up of despair, as she describes it, clearly has initiatory dimensions. For in feeling the depth of our despair we may, in fact, “disintegrate.” But this is “positive disintegration”: “It is helpful in despair work to realize that going to pieces or falling apart is not such a bad thing. Indeed, it is as essential to evolutionary and psychic transformation as the cracking of outgrown shells, ... Our ‘going to pieces,’ however uncomfortable a process, can open us up to new perception, new data, new response.... There is healing in such openness, for ourselves and perhaps for the world.”3 In admitting our craziness, we must face our despair. And In facing despair, we deepen our craziness. Yet it is a necessary part of our initiation. We may also, temporarily, deepen our numbing. In any “positive disintegration” there is resistance, a natural refusal of the psyche to fall apart, and thus there is refusal to feel, But this, too, may have to be accepted as necessary, with trust that it is merely temporary and that those who accept the need to transcend their present state will transcend the numbing as well, Every facet of our “death in life” must be tasted to its fullest. In order to “imagine the real” we must open ourselves to the feelings of total craziness, total despair, and total numbing, as moments on our way to the fourth level.‚- This painful necessity points back to the central importance of symbolism Macy writes: “To acknowledge and express our despair, we need images and symbols….Exercise of the imagination is especially necessary, because existing verbal constructs seem inadequate to what many of us are sensing…we are groping in the dark, with shattered beliefs and faltering hopes, and we need images for this phase if we are to work through it.” While the Bomb shows us once again our need for symbolic images, it also shows us that we may already have the images we need. For what better image of despair is there than the image of nuclear war itself? What better image of madness and of “death in life” than nuclear catastrophe? But the problem we have consistently encountered is the relatively unthreatening and even appealing elements in all these images. And it may be that all such images of chaos, expressing numinous power and the coincidence of opposites in the big whoosh, must inevitably have attractive aspects. Yet there may be some which come closer to reflecting the total horror of nuclear war. These are the images we must agree to face if we are to confront our despair and the reality that lurks behind it. </document> <Summary> Honesty compels us to admit that we've been living through a classic initiation, turning this necessity into a virtue.
To build a new level of existence, we must embrace initiatory situations, where the old must die for the new to emerge.
Our current chaotic state is an initiatory experience, requiring dissolution and integration for a higher level of wholeness.
The Bomb has made this initiatory journey possible, leading us towards a fourth level of integration.
This chaotic phase demands a confrontation with despair, as we face the reality of our situation and embrace necessary transformations.
Joanna Rogers Macy emphasizes the importance of acknowledging despair and using imagination and symbols to navigate through it.
Symbolism is crucial in expressing and working through despair, providing imagery for the phases we're navigating.
The image of nuclear war serves as a potent symbol of despair and chaos, reflecting the horror we must confront. </Summary>"

"<document> Is U.S. influence in Latin America on the wane? It depends how you look at it.¶ As President Obama travels to Mexico and Costa Rica, it’s likely the pundits will once again underscore what some perceive to be the eroding influence of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. Some will point to the decline in foreign aid or the absence of an overarching policy with an inspiring moniker like “Alliance for Progress” or “Enterprise Area of the Americas” as evidence that the United States is failing to embrace the opportunities of a region that is more important to this country than ever.¶ The reality is a lot more complicated. Forty-two percent of all U.S. exports flow to the Western Hemisphere. In many ways, U.S. engagement in the Americas is more pervasive than ever, even if more diffused. That is in part because the peoples of the Western Hemisphere are not waiting for governments to choreograph their interactions.¶ A more-nuanced assessment inevitably will highlight the complex, multidimensional ties between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere. In fact, it may be that we need to change the way we think and talk about the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. We also need to resist the temptation to embrace overly reductive yardsticks for judging our standing in the hemisphere.¶ As Moises Naim notes in his recent book, The End of Power, there has been an important change in power distribution in the world away from states toward an expanding and increasingly mobile set of actors that are dramatically shaping the nature and scope of global relationships. In Latin America, many of the most substantive and dynamic forms of engagement are occurring in a web of cross-national relationships involving small and large companies, people-to-people contact through student exchanges and social media, travel and migration.¶ Trade and investment remain the most enduring and measurable dimensions of U.S. </document> <Summary> As President Obama travels to Mexico and Costa Rica, it’s likely the pundits will once again underscore what some perceive to be the eroding influence of the United States in the Western Hemisphere.
 
Some will point to the decline in foreign aid or the absence of an overarching policy with an inspiring moniker like “Alliance for Progress” or “Enterprise Area of the Americas” as evidence that the United States is failing to embrace the opportunities of a region that is more important to this country than ever.
 
The reality is a lot more complicated. Forty-two percent of all U.S. exports flow to the Western Hemisphere.
 
In many ways, U.S. engagement in the Americas is more pervasive than ever, even if more diffused.
 
A more-nuanced assessment inevitably will highlight the complex, multidimensional ties between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere.

"<document> Emergency systems Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems. That power is normally tapped off of the electricity that the reactor generates. If the plant is offline, the power is provided by the electrical grid. But what happens when the grid itself goes down? The short answer is that large on-site diesel generators automatically activate to provide electricity. And if those should fail, portable diesel generators, which are also on-site, can be connected. Recent standardization has also ensured that generators can be swapped between plants without the need to retrofit connectors. There are also a couple of additional emergency systems that can be used specifically to cool the reactor. These include the turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump, which uses steam generated by the reactor to power a cooling turbine. The pump requires an operator, but it runs completely without electricity. This system, however, is meant only for emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few days when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature, not for long-term cooling. And finally, in the worst case, most plants have a method of bringing in river or ocean water to flood the reactor. This typically damages the cooling system, but again, it helps to cool and cover the reactor core should all else fail. Unlike in other countries, permission from the federal government is not required to flood the reactor. Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems to the backup systems, it would seem that there’s nothing to worry about, right? Under all but the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct. However, one could imagine a scenario in which the grid was lost and the diesel generators ran out of fuel. Speaking of fuel, how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, there is enough fuel to run the emergency diesel generators for at least 42 days. I say at least because it would depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the reactor was cooled down, a much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System, would be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The generators and onsite fuel supply could power that smaller cooling system for significantly longer than if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system. Even if we assumed a worst case of 42 days, it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which that would not be enough time to bring in additional fuel either by land, water, or air. Nonetheless, let’s push the question a little further. What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel was exhausted? Even with the reactor having been successfully cooled, the biggest risk would continue to be overheating of the fuel rod assemblies, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. Without circulation, the heat from the fuel rod assemblies could boil the surrounding water, resulting in steam. In turn, the water levels would drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to air. Once exposed to air, their temperatures would rise but not to the levels that would melt the zirconium cladding. Thankfully, that means that meltdown would not occur. The steam might well carry radioactive contaminants into the air, but there would be no release of hydrogen and, thus, no subsequent explosions. The situation would certainly be dangerous to surrounding communities, but it wouldn’t be the nuclear Armageddon that many people worry about. </document> <Summary> Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems.

Speaker 3: In essence, as I mentioned this morning, the chief of police, when she first arrived, I think about three or four months after she arrived as our chief of police made we made a request to our city city auditor's office to have the overtime usage and processes and tools at the Seattle Police Department be subject to an audit
Speaker 3: by the city auditor. As the result of that particular request, there were 30 recommendations that were issued by the city auditor related to some failings in control systems at the Seattle Police Department. And all of those 30 recommendations were accepted by the police department.
Speaker 3: And this resolution is intended to, in a in a different way, impose upon the Seattle Police Department clear milestones and deadlines and expectations around deliverables in terms of how it is they are complying with the auditor's recommendations. This this resolution, in my mind, is critically important to ensure that we continue to have a police department that is
Speaker 3: accountable, not just in police misconduct, police accountability, police discipline issues, but also on the operations side. And I think that Councilmember Burgess made a very fine point in committee last week when we heard from the department that they would like to engage in a conversation around whether the overtime budget allocated to the department is accurate.
Speaker 3: In response to that, Councilmember Burgess indicated that. Why don't we try to figure out how to get this house in order before we throw more money at the house? And so I think that that's an important point. My hope is that this overtime resolution will steer us in that direction so that we are making sure that the

Speaker 7: The Santa monica.
Speaker 3: Rivers and Mountains Conservancy as well. And we are essentially just contributing to the pool of money that's looking at a way to revitalize the entire stretch of the Los Angeles River in a holistic way that will add recommendations and layers as to the types of developments that we can have in our portion.
Speaker 7: That would be.

Item 23 is a report from the Office of Councilmember Patrick O'Donnell, Councilwoman Geri Sheepskin Councilmember Stephen Neil with a recommendation to request city manager to prepare a letter of support for Assembly Bill 1839, also known as the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act.
Speaker 11: It's on the calendar.
Speaker 9: Joining us over to Councilmember O'Donnell.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I take council I ask you to weigh in in support of AB 1839. That's the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act. Since the late 1990s, film production has been lured from California to other states.
Speaker 4: Louisiana being a key state that has been stealing our our jobs, our film production. In 2009, the state legislature passed the California Film and Television Tax Credit Program to promote film production and create and retain jobs in California.
Speaker 4: Tonight, we ask that you support a rebooting and revamping of that effort by supporting AB 1839. California's current incentive program is one of the smaller programs nationally, and expanding it will allow for more jobs and tax revenue to be created in California and actually in Long Beach, because we are a very film friendly city and consider it
Speaker 4: our job to act as a partner with our region to keep the film industry in California, tax revenue generated from filming helps to pay for teachers, police officers and infrastructure throughout the state. So Council, I'll make a motion that we weigh in in support of AB 1839 to keep quality jobs in California.
Speaker 10: So second.
Speaker 9: There's been a motion and a second, any public comment on the item, please?
Speaker 5: Patrick Kelly, Teamsters Local 952 Joint Council 42. We strongly urge support of this. I think most of you saw the article in the L.A. Times the other day that 16,000 jobs have been lost in California alone over the last several years.
Speaker 5: New York State is providing between 400 and $500 million in film credits to basically raid California. So whatever you can do to encourage and keep film production here is great. Thank you.
Speaker 9: Councilmember Neill, did you have a comment? Okay. There's a motion on the floor and the other public comment. Who made the second councilman. Okay, great. All right, so let's go and take a vote.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Andrews, please. Councilor Dylan. Motion carry symbol? Yes.

"<document> Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed ""powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children."" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. ""It was horror,"" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. ""People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone."" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: ""If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,"" he said. ""Blackwater killed my son."" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government ""should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened."" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first . Wesley Bruer reported in Washington. Michael Pearson reported and wrote in Atlanta. </document> <Summary> Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead.

"<document> This kind of research is more evidence to support the idea that evolution thrives on culling. The planet did really well from the Big Five mass-extinction events. The victims’ demise enabled new environments to develop and more diversification took place in other groups of animals and plants. Nature was the richer for it. In just this same way the planet can take advantage from the abuse we are giving it. The harder the abuse, the greater the change to the environment. But it also follows that it brings forward the extinctions of a whole selection of vulnerable organisms. If humans were to fall into this vulnerable category, we too would become extinct. The effect of this would be that the abuse would stop being inflicted and peace and quiet would return. It would take several thousands of years for this to happen, and even longer for many different new ecosystems to reach a steady state of climax. Meanwhile, of course, evolution would set to work and increase the diversity of the newly selected forms, without the threat of humans and all the other species that our extinction event killed off. </document> <Summary> This kind of research is more evidence to support the idea that evolution thrives on culling.

"<document> Conflict and US Military Spending How does one measure polarity? Power is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted formula exists. Perhaps overall military spending might be thought of as a proxy for hard power capabilities; perhaps too the amount of money the United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of the unipole. When compared to conflict levels, however, there is no obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative relationship between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic stability theorists would expect to see. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on defense by about 25 percent, spending $100 billion less in real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 To those believers in the neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible “peace dividend” endangered both national and global security. “No serious analyst of American military capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America’s responsibilities to itself and to world peace,” argued Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 The world grew dramatically more peaceful while the United States cut its forces, however, and stayed just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the military budget was cut under President Clinton, in other words, and kept declining (though more slowly, since levels were already low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up. Overall US military spending has varied during the period of the New Peace from a low in constant dollars of less than $400 billion to a high of more than $700 billion, but war does not seem to have noticed. The same nonrelationship exists between other potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict: there does not seem to be much connection between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP, alliance commitments, and forward military presence. There was very little fighting in Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there, for example, and that has not changed as the number of Americans dwindled by 90 percent.

That digital ambush was followed by a cyber attack on Georgian websites a year later in the run-up to the brief shooting war between Tbilisi and Moscow, as well as allegations of a colossal, ongoing cyber espionage campaign against the United States by hackers linked to the Chinese army. ¶ Much of the concern has focused on potential attacks on the U.S. electrical grid. ""If I were an attacker and I wanted to do strategic damage to the United States...I probably would sack electric power on the U.S. East Coast, maybe the West Coast, and attempt to cause a cascading effect,"" retired Admiral Mike McConnell said in a 2010 interview with CBS's 60 Minutes. ¶ But the scenarios sketched out above are not solely the realm of fantasy. This summer, the United States and India were hit by two massive electrical outages -- caused not by ninja cyber assault teams but by force majeure. And, for most people anyway, the results were less terrifying than imagined. ¶ First, the freak ""derecho"" storm that barreled across a heavily-populated swath of the eastern United States on the afternoon of June 29 knocked down trees that crushed cars, bashed holes in roofs, blocked roads, and sliced through power lines. ¶ According to an August report by the U.S. Department of Energy, 4.2 million homes and businesses lost power as a result of the storm, with the blackout stretching across 11 states and the District of Columbia. More than 1 million customers were still without power five days later, and in some areas power wasn't restored for 10 days. Reuters put the death tollat 23 people as of July 5, all killed by storms or heat stroke. ¶ The second incident occurred in late July, when 670 million people in northern India, or about 10 percent of the world's population, lost power in the largest blackout in history. The failure of this huge chunk of India's electric grid was attributed to higher-than-normal demand due to late monsoon rains, which led farmers to use more electricity in order to draw water from wells. Indian officials told the media there were no reports of deaths directly linked to the blackouts. ¶ But this cataclysmic event didn't cause widespread chaos in India -- indeed, for some, it didn't even interrupt their daily routine. ""[M]any people in major cities barely noticed the disruption because localized blackouts are so common that many businesses, hospitals, offices and middle-class homes have backup diesel generators,"" the New York Timesreported. ¶ The most important thing about both events is what didn't happen. Planes didn't fall out of the sky. Governments didn't collapse. Thousands of people weren't killed.

Imagine, if you will, that the United States is blindsided by an epic hack that interrupts power for much of the Midwest and mid-Atlantic for more than a week, switching off the lights, traffic signals, computers, water pumps, and air conditioners in millions of homes, businesses, and government offices. 
Americans swelter in the dark. 
Chaos reigns!  
Blackouts on this scale conjure images of civil unrest, overwhelmed police, crippled hospitals, darkened military bases, the gravely injured in the back of ambulances stuck in traffic jams. 
The specter of what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called a digital Pearl Harbor led to the creation of U.S. Cyber Command, which is tasked with developing both offensive and defensive cyber warfare capabilities, and prompted FBI Director Robert Mueller to warn in March that cyber attacks would soon be the number one threat to our country.
Similar concerns inspired both the Democrats and Republicans to sound the alarm about the cyber threat in their party platforms. 
Or has fear of full-blown cybergeddon at the hands of America's enemies become just another feverish national obsession -- another of the long, dark shadows of the 9/11 attacks?
This summer, the United States and India were hit by two massive electrical outages -- caused not by ninja cyber assault teams but by force majeure. 
And, for most people anyway, the results were less terrifying than imagined.
The most important thing about both events is what didn't happen. 
Planes didn't fall out of the sky. 
Governments didn't collapse. 
Thousands of people weren't killed.
Despite disruption and delay, harried public officials, emergency workers, and beleaguered publics mostly muddled through. 
The summer's blackouts strongly suggest that a cyber weapon that took down an electric grid even for several days could turn out to be little more than a weapon of mass inconvenience.
That doesn't mean the United States can relax. 
James Lewis, director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes that hackers threaten the security of U.S. utilities and industries, and recently penned an op-ed for the New York Times calling the United States defenseless to a cyber-assault.
But he told Foreign Policy the recent derecho showed that even a large-scale blackout would not necessarily have catastrophic consequences. </Summary>"

"<document> Speaker 1: Log in number 026 to Council of Florida for the following order for a hearing to discuss offering property tax abatements to property owners in the Newmarket area.
Speaker 0: The chair recognizes counsel. Clarity. Counsel, clarity. You of the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. As everybody on this body knows, particularly the district councils that have been covering this, the residents and business owners in the Newmarket and Mass and Cass area have experienced deteriorating and at times horrific conditions over the last several years.
Speaker 0: That includes decline in public safety, decline of public health, overall cleanliness in general, a decrease in their quality of life that are not necessarily reflected in property valuations in this area. As an at large councilor, I've done numerous walkthroughs with residents and business owners and advocates, along with neighborhood groups, city department leaders.
Speaker 0: And despite those efforts to increase city services and to better coordinate efforts across departments to meet the increased need in the area, and that includes expedited needle cleanup, sidewalk cleaning, mental health outreach and street workers, etc. We've still fallen short on our standards.
Speaker 0: So much so that the new market businesses have created a new market bid and are going around collecting fees from their members to finance supplemental services above and beyond what the city has been providing property taxes as folks now make up nearly 75% of our revenues.
Speaker 0: So again, suggesting an abatement for property taxes is not something that I take that I do serve lightly as a fiscal steward of the city. That said, I think this is a very unique and special case, and I feel that in recognition of our shortcomings, to provide an adequate level of city services to to the homeowners and
Speaker 0: to the business owners in the area, that we should explore the idea of offering a property tax abatement. Generally speaking, the driving idea behind this seeming order is the notion that taxpayers do deserve a high level of basic city services.
Speaker 0: And to some degree, I think we've dropped the ball here. And so looking forward to an expedited hearing, bring in the stakeholders. Let's talk about what area it would encompass and whether or not it makes sense for the city to offer them something even while the bid is ramping up.
Speaker 0: Maybe that's something that we can offer them. In addition to, we're going to be going at those businesses to to increase their contribution and or to make payments to the bid. And maybe we can offer them something in the short term that takes a little bit of a bite out of getting the bid going strong.
Speaker 0: And again, I know that there are folks here, our colleague Russell Baker is done, a lot of great work done. So Flynn on the bid not working with those folks. So this would be, I guess, a complement to that that if we can provide an abatement to to the residents, the homeowners business owners over there, you know
Speaker 0: , it may take a little bit out of their feeling that we, the city, have abandoned them over the last few years. As conditions continue to deteriorate in the area, they look forward again and feel free to hear some comments and welcome folks to sign on.
Speaker 0: Thank you, counsel. Clarity. Would any other counsel like to speak on this issue? If you do, can you please raise your hand? I see. Counsel Arroyo, the chair recognizes Counsel Arroyo. You have the floor. Thank you. President Flynn, I just have a question for the chairman.
Speaker 0: Would this apply to the residential folks in the area as well for some of the same similar reasoning? Or is this just for the business folks? And why the distinction or difference? Great. Thank you for the question. As referenced in my comments, the focus will be on the homeowners, the residents that are there.
Speaker 0: That's sort of priority number one, the residents and then obviously the businesses, both of them combined equally. And I've done the walk, as I'm sure you have, as well as our other colleagues up and down all those neighborhood streets and listening to the talk about having to clean out the needles and having their cars broken into and
Speaker 0: having people urinating and defecating and literally having sex out front of their house in their window, all of it trash, graffiti. And they continue to call us. They continue to reach out to the city, to public works, to everyone that would listen.
Speaker 0: And again, they felt that it fell on deaf ears, just given the complexity of the situation and all the issues that were involved with it and trying to deal with it in a in a in both balancing sort of the public safety and the public health needs.
Speaker 0: And sometimes they were on the same page, sometimes they weren't. So the the homeowners, the residents and some of them some of the city's highest taxpayers are in are in some of these properties. So. So, yes, the question is there will be for both.
Speaker 0: Thank you for that clarification. Please add my name. President. Yeah. Please said council Moreno's name. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter before we go to talk to others? Council braided. Your hand is raised. Beg your.

"<document> In some ways, the concept of inequality is unhelpful here. There has rarely been a political or business leader who has stood up and publicly said, “society needs more inequality”. And yet, most of the policies and regulations which have driven inequality since the 1970s have been publicly known. Although it is tempting to look back and feel duped by the pre-2008 era, it was relatively clear what was going on, and how it was being justified. But rather than speak in terms of generating more inequality, policy-makers have always favoured another term, which effectively comes to the same thing: competitiveness. My new book, The Limits of Neoliberalism: Sovereignty, Authority & The Logic of Competition, is an attempt to understand the ways in which political authority has been reconfigured in terms of the promotion of competitiveness. Competitiveness is an interesting concept, and an interesting principle on which to base social and economic institutions. When we view situations as ‘competitions’, we are assuming that participants have some vaguely equal opportunity at the outset. But we are also assuming that they are striving for maximum inequality at the conclusion. To demand ‘competitiveness’ is to demand that people prove themselves relative to one other. It struck me, when I began my Sociology PhD on which the book is based, that competitiveness had become one of the great unquestioned virtues of contemporary culture, especially in the UK. We celebrate London because it is a competitive world city; we worship sportsmen for having won; we turn on our televisions and watch contestants competitively cooking against each other. In TV shows such as the Dragons Den or sporting contests such as the Premier League, the division between competitive entertainment and capitalism dissolves altogether. Why would it be remotely surprising, to discover that a society in which competitiveness was a supreme moral and cultural virtue, should also be one which generates increasing levels of inequality? Unless one wants to descend into biological reductionism, the question then has to be posed: how did this state of affairs come about? To answer this, we need to turn firstly to the roots of neoliberal thinking in the 1930s. For Friedrich Hayek in London, the ordoliberals in Freiburg and Henry Simons in Chicago, competition wasn’t just one feature of a market amongst many. It was the fundamental reason why markets were politically desirable, because it conserved the uncertainty of the future. What united all forms of totalitarianism and planning, according to Hayek, was that they refused to tolerate competition. And hence a neoliberal state would be defined first and foremost as one which used its sovereign powers to defend competitive processes, using anti-trust law and other instruments. </document> <Summary> There has rarely been a political or business leader who has stood up and publicly said, “society needs more inequality”.

"<document> Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986 . Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009 . Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters . ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’ It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National . ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011 . Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament . ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’ Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore. </document> <Summary> Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments.

"<document> This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: ‘Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’ and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’, also organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best ""them"" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control . </document> <Summary> This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing their tears dripping into a cup.

"<document> Chris Ramsey has pledged his long-term future to QPR – insisting he will remain at the club for as long as they want him. Ramsey was handed the manager’s job until the end of the season after stepping up from his youth development coaching role when Harry Redknapp resigned in February. Rangers’ Premier League status is hanging by the thread following Sunday’s last-gasp defeat by Chelsea at Loftus Road, but Ramsey insists he is more than happy to remain in W12 regardless of what division they are in next season, although he hopes to be made permanent boss. Chris Ramsey insists he's happy at Queens Park Rangers and will stay at the club for as long as they want him . In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail the 52-year-old said: ‘I’m a QPR person now, whatever happens there’s a long-term project at the club which Les (Ferdinand) has put into place anyway. ‘We’re going to try and build the academy in order to emulate one or two of the clubs who we can see have excelled in the Premier League with the right foundations in place. ‘As long as the club want me I will remain here – it’s as simple as that. I want to stay at QPR, I’m really happy. The 52-year-old is a popular and respected man within the game, with aspirations of getting the full-time job . ‘To be honest with you QPR have been quite loyal to me as when I first joined I got offered a few first-team jobs elsewhere and I didn’t take them, but they allowed me to talk to these clubs and they could have easily told me to do one then but they didn’t, so I feel like I owe them. ‘So now I’m going to stand by them and show them some loyalty.’ Speculation has been rife that Ramsey will link up with his former Tottenham colleague Tim Sherwood at Aston Villa this summer if he wasn’t handed the job on a permanent basis, but he says his mind is focused solely on QPR currently. Reports suggest that Ramsey could link up with friend Tim Sherwood (left) at Aston Villa in the summer . ‘At the moment all I am thinking about is staying at QPR,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘Regardless of whether we stay up or not I think I’ve got a fighting chance of getting the job (on a permanent basis). ‘Obviously I think Les wants me to be the manager because he knows I can do the job, and I think Tony (Fernandes) would want me to be in charge, too.' QPR owner Tony Fernandes is the man who will make the final decision as to who becomes the next manager . Speaking at the ‘Sport On Board’ graduation event at Wembley on Wednesday night, a group designed to help improve diversity across the boardrooms in football, the former Tottenham coach spoke glowingly about Ferdinand – who was appointed as the club’s director of football in the wake of Redknapp’s departure. The pair both graduated from the course last year, with Ramsey highlighting how pivotal a role it has played in Ferdinand’s career especially. He added: ‘For Les especially this course has been fantastic. He’s always said this is the job he’s wanted and already I can see what a great job he is doing. Director of football Les Ferdinand (left) would like his friend Ramsey to get the job on a permanent basis . ‘There is no doubt in my mind he will go on to become one of the best in that field, and he will turn this club round one way or another.’ Ramsey himself has aspirations of becoming a top manager one day, with the No 1 hotseat the thing he has his heart set on right now. ‘I’m at that stage in my life now where if a managerial position came up I’d have to take it – and hopefully that will be at QPR. ‘These jobs are limited in the game and you may never have an opportunity to be a No 1 again. Star man Charlie Austin could be off in the summer - regardless of whether QPR stay in the Premier League . ‘You know what in the end I might not be a good enough No 1, but I think I will be. ‘So then you go and give your utmost and without banging the drum too much be confident in your own ability, which I am. ‘The main thing for anybody, unless you're very famous, is to stay in the industry, though. I’m blessed to have remained involved in the game for as long as I have been.' </document> <Summary> Chris Ramsey has pledged his long-term future to QPR— insisting he will remain at the club for as long as they want him.

"<document> Unfortunately, after numerous investigations, Congressional hearings, and the finding of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling (Oil Spill Commission) that the disaster’s “root causes are systemic and, absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur,” the stage is set for a repeat performance. If a similar disaster happened today, there’s no guarantee that we wouldn’t get the same result: oil covered beaches and wetlands, oil drenched birds and sea turtles, millions of gallons of toxic dispersants introduced into the environment and our food chain, a fishing industry struggling to survive, and a mass die off of dolphins. “Trust us,” said the oil and gas industry before the BP disaster, “Our blowout preventers will work and we can clean up any spilled oil before it seriously impacts the environment.” Today, the oil and gas industry continues to ask for our trust, even though the design flaw in the Cameron-style blowout preventers that was identified in the BOEMRE-commissioned technical report still exists, and even though the undersea containment systems that the industry and BOEM are relying on to cap a wild well quickly have not been tested at the depths and pressures of current and proposed deepwater wells. The Helix system has been tested on a tabletop in Houston, but the tabletop was not under water. On the government side, while the Department of Interior has embraced some significant reforms (for example, creating the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to enforce safety and environmental regulations ostensibly immune from pressures to expand oil and gas production and maximize government revenues), the government agency charged with overseeing oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), continues to make critical decisions on expanding oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico without site-specific analyses of the risks to the environment and human health. </document> <Summary> After numerous investigations, Congressional hearings, and the finding of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, the disaster’s “root causes are systemic and, absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur.”

The Baggies are on the market with chairman Jeremy Peace understood to want between £150million and £200million for the club. Groups from America, Australia and the Far East are believed to be interested in buying Albion after Peace confirmed he would be open to offers in February. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is hoping to sell the club for between £150million and £200million . Manager Tony Pulis has been assured that the deal will be done by July, so as not to affect pre-season . He has set a July deadline to complete any deal to ensure it does not drag out and hamper their summer transfer plans under head coach Tony Pulis. Should he fail to sell the club, though, then Peace, who has been chairman for 13 years, will remain committed to Albion, who are on course to seal a sixth straight season in the Barclays Premier League. Pulis said on Monday he was unaware of any imminent sale but Peace has given him assurances it will not drag on over the summer.

"<document> Cad: Poet Rupert Brooke had a string of short-lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in April 1915 . Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the First World War. But a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down. The documents, brought to light for the first time thanks to a £430,000 grant, show Brooke's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously. The letters are part of the John Schroder collection, which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by King's College, Cambridge, where the poet was a student. Brooke, who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27, became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as The Soldier. His obituary was written by Winston Churchill, who called him 'all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be'. However, the letters in the Schroder collection - including 170 documents written by Brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet. King's archivist Patricia McGuire said that Brooke was 'promiscuous even for a man of his time' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends. 'Several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to,' Dr McGuire told The Times. 'I think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could.' Among the lovers whose affairs with Brooke are featured in the letters are Hollywood star Cathleen Nesbitt, artist Phyllis Gardner, and Laurence Olivier's cousin Noël. Lovers: Cathleen Nesbitt, left, and Phyllis Gardner, right, are among the women who had affairs with Brooke . Popular: Brooke became one of Britain's best-loved poets after his premature death . Nesbitt wrote to Eddie Marsh, Brooke's biographer, saying: 'I've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor, I hope, has Rupert - though I shouldn't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam.' In another letter, she described the poet's care-free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war. Nesbitt wrote: 'When I talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say, ""Hush - there's never any end when things are perfect.""' This is not the first time that Brooke's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on Jews and homosexuals. And this year a book about his affair with Phyllis Gardner revealed that he opposed the women's rights movements and privately said that 'all women are beasts'. The pair bathed naked together near Grantchester, the village outside Cambridge where Brooke lived in the Old Vicarage, now home to Jeffrey Archer. Trove: Peter Jones of King's College, Cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a £430,000 grant . Home: The Old Vicarage in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, where Brooke once lived . If I should die, think only this of me: . That there's some corner of a foreign field . That is forever England. There shall be . In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; . A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, . Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, . A body of England's, breathing English air, . Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, . A pulse in the eternal mind, no less . Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; . Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; . And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, . In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Despite the recent revelations, Brooke has retained his image as a 'young Apollo' cut down in his prime, whose poems encapsulate typically English scenes. His poem The Soldier, featuring the line 'there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', was immensely popular during the First World War, and made even more poignant when Brooke himself died while on active service on April 23, 1915. Churchill wrote in his obituary, published in The Times: 'He was all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered.' Peter Jones, the librarian at King's, said: 'It is hard to realise today just how significant Brooke's impact was 100 years ago. 'In the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200-300 copies of your work. Just after his death, Brooke's close friend and patron Eddie Marsh published 1914 and Other Poems. 'The first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and, in all, 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions.' He added: 'We now know much more about Brooke as a person and he is certainly more interesting and, in some ways more difficult, than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death. 'He was a conflicted individual. He had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him.' One of the letters now made available reveals how Brooke's mother Mary Ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon, and also intervened to stop Marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships. Lorna Beckett, chairman of the Rupert Brooke Society, said: 'He was an interesting, complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the ""young Apollo"" myth created straight after his death.' </document> <Summary> Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the First World War.

"<document> If the most telling scorecard of a U.S. presidency is the economy, then President Joe Biden deserves high marks for his first 100 days. It’s a small sample, of course – featuring data for just a couple of months – but measures of job growth and retail sales pointed to a booming economy in March. And analysts say that’s likely just the beginning of a historically robust year. Much of the surge can be traced to growing COVID-19 vaccinations – with 40% of the population having received at least one shot, according to Goldman Sachs – a leveling off of virus cases, and the lifting of business restrictions in many states. And don’t forget the nearly $4 trillion in Congress’s COVID-19 relief packages, including $1,800 per person in stimulus checks sent to most Americans through December. In other words, the economy was on track to bust out even before Biden moved into the White House. “Just the economy reopening would go a long way toward healing the wounds,” says Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial. Yet under Biden, the vaccine rollout has been faster than expected at more than 3 million shots a day the past couple of weeks. “Biden gets props for getting the vaccine process sped up,” Moody says. He also spearheaded the latest $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, passed by Congress in March, that includes another round of $1,400 stimulus checks. The Treasury Department says it has disbursed 161 million of those payments totaling $379 billion. All told, Americans are flush with an additional $2.4 trillion that they’ve squirreled way during the outbreak and they’re ready to spend much of it just as the economy is getting back on its feet. Put simply, the president helped put a strong recovery on steroids. “We can give Biden credit for improving consumer and business confidence,” says Bernard Baumohl, chief economist of the Economic Outlook Group. There are still risks, including the possibility of COVID-19 spikes that outpace vaccinations. Another hindrance could be the supply-chain delays, including chip shortages, that have hobbled manufacturers and undermined sales of cars, smartphones and other products. </document> <Summary> If the most telling scorecard of a U.S. presidency is the economy, then President Joe Biden deserves high marks for his first 100 days.

"<document> While states and LEAs will now have greater responsibility and a more uniform methodological approach to disproportionate representation identification, the framework remains largely unchanged from the old approach based upon principles of education federalism.165 Overall, the new provisions continue to require states to use a standard methodology to determine whether there is significant disproportionality based on race or ethnicity.166 Each state must set “reasonable risk ratio threshold[s],” and “reasonable” minimum number of students within a reported subgroup.167 However, states are still given great flexibility as to how to determine when significant disproportionality exists.168 In fact, states can choose not to identify an LEA that has previously exceeded risk ratio thresholds as an LEA with significant disproportionality as long as the LEA is making “reasonable” progress in lowering its risk ratio.169 As with the previous regulations, the state sets its own determination for what constitutes “reasonable” progress.170 Thus, the concern remains that the new approach to examining, identifying, and rectifying disproportionate representation of racial or ethnic minority students with disabilities will not adequately address the underlying civil rights issues that remain.171 Moreover, coupled with case precedent firmly establishing that plaintiff parents and students need more than a showing of an IDEA finding of significant disproportionality or patterns of inappropriate district-wide identification and assessment procedures for special education placements to prove intentional discrimination, how do potential plaintiff parents and students best ensure that states and LEAs are engaged in equitable practices and enforcement with the special education identification and assessment processes? This Conclusion outlines several considerations for future practice </document> <Summary> While states and LEAs will now have greater responsibility and a more uniform methodological approach to disproportionate representation identification, the framework remains largely unchanged from the old approach based upon principles of education federalism.
The new provisions continue to require states to use a standard methodology to determine whether there is significant disproportionality based on race or ethnicity.
States are still given great flexibility in determining when significant disproportionality exists, and they can choose not to identify an LEA with significant disproportionality if progress is made in lowering the risk ratio. </Summary>"

American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane: American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

"<document> The shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in corporation tax . Ed Balls yesterday opened the door to a tax raid on businesses, which critics warn would endanger the economic recovery. In a TV interview, the shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in the main rate of corporation tax if Labour form the next government. He was also evasive about the 40p rate of income tax, into which millions of people have been dragged in recent years, saying he was unsure how quickly the threshold could be raised. Businesses are already concerned about Labour’s stated plans not to cut corporation tax – paid by all large firms on their profits – as the Tories have vowed to if they win office. The main rate has been brought down under the Coalition from 28 per cent to 21 per cent. Asked if he would raise it, Mr Balls would only commit to keeping the main rate ‘the lowest in the G7’ group of countries. This leaves room to raise it up to 26.5 per cent, the level which is imposed in Canada. When it was suggested Labour could levy a rate of ‘24 per cent or 25 per cent’, he did not rule it out, simply saying: ‘We need to make sure we back businesses ... we will keep our rates low.’ John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, warned last week that Labour’s plans to intervene in markets, such as the energy market, and their ‘signals on corporation tax are a cause for concern’. He added that any rise in business taxes would ‘undermine progress to make the whole tax system more competitive and send the wrong signal to firms of all sectors and sizes.’ Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said the prospect of a business tax rise was a ‘clear threat to working people’s future economic security’. He said: ‘It’s clear Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are leaving the door open to a damaging tax rise that risks costing jobs, risks costing investment and risks the economic recovery.’ The Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think-tank has said raising corporation tax to 24 per cent gradually over the next five years would cost nearly 100,000 jobs by the end of the Parliament. Labour say by keeping corporation tax at the current rate, they can freeze business rates for 1.5million small firms. The main rate has been brought down from 28 per cent to 21 per cent under the coalition with the Tories vowing to lower corporation tax if they win the Election . Lloyds bank shares on offer for all . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year, David Cameron pledged yesterday. In the latest Tory attempt to revive the free market spirit of the 1980s, millions of small investors willing to spend £250 or more would be given priority access to shares still owned from the 2008 bank bailout. If the party wins the election, the sale would begin with a publicity drive similar to the ‘Tell Sid’ adverts that pushed the 1986 privatisation of British Gas. The plan would see up to £4billion of Lloyds shares sold off at a discount of at least 5 per cent, with individual investors allowed to spend up to £10,000. To counter any claims of a ‘get rich quick’ sell-off, buyers who keep the shares for a year would be rewarded with a loyalty bonus of one extra free share for every ten they hold. The sale would also recoup billions for the Exchequer to pay off some of the country’s vast national debts. Yesterday the Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this would be the first time there had been such an offer for individual investors. ‘The taxpayer put billions into these banks and I want to get the money back,’ he said. ‘At the same time I think having people being able to own shares in a healthy, successful British bank is the sort of country we should be building.’ Labour said the Tories had announced the sell-off policy seven times already – including before the last election. Lib Dem Danny Alexander said the idea had been rejected over the past five years ‘because it’s not been clear that we’d be able to get the money back for the taxpayer’. Lloyds was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008, leaving it 43 per cent state owned. The Government still owns £12.5billion of shares, which were worth 78.7p each on Friday – compared to the 73.6p paid by Gordon Brown. </document> <Summary> Ed Balls yesterday opened the door to a tax raid on businesses, which critics warn would endanger the economic recovery.

"<document> An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Brandy Ward (right) was killed in the mudslide that swept Oso, Washington, in March last year. Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News. </document> <Summary> An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year.

"<document> A nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she'd never had the disease. A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients. As a result, Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer following a biopsy. Doctors advised the 39-year-old that she needed immediate surgery, suggesting a double mastectomy. Ms Dawes refused, but did undergo major surgery to remove a 'cancerous' tumour from her right breast as well as lymph nodes from her armpit. Elizabeth Dawes, 39, was told she had breast cancer in July 2013. Doctors at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton told her she needed immediate surgery and chemotherapy. But four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with those of other patients, and she'd never had cancer . The mother-of-one was also told she would need a further procedure to correct 'deformities' to her breasts caused by the first operation. But four days later, Ms Dawes was asked to attend an appointment with her consultant. There, he revealed there had been a mix-up with her hospital notes and those of two other patients, - and she had, in fact, never had the disease. She said: 'I am absolutely appalled at what I have been through and am still struggling to comprehend how this could even happen. 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order.' 'I was willing to undergo whatever treatment it took to fight the cancer so when I was told I needed surgery, I didn't think twice.' Ms Dawes was so traumatised she needed anti-depressants and was forced to give up her job in the oncology department at New Cross Hospital. , added: 'The doctor also told me I would need a bilateral breast lift to cosmetically improve the shape of my breasts, as otherwise, after having the cancer surgery I would be left deformed. 'I was very sore after the operation and shocked by the extensive scaring, so to be recalled four days later to be told none of it was necessary was truly horrendous. 'I am still in pain now, have lost a lot of sensation in my breasts and the scarring has not improved, which hugely affects my self-confidence. 'Nothing can make up for what has happened but I am determined to see justice done and feel I at least deserve an official apology from the Trust given the huge impact this has had on my life.' Ms Dawes, who has an 18-year-old son, is taking legal action. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability for the misdiagnosis and the unnecessary surgery performed. The mother-of-one, who was working as a breast cancer care nurse at the same hospital at the time, said: 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order' Lawyer Louise Hawkley, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a truly shocking case that has left Elizabeth appalled at the unnecessary heartache, and extensive scarring she has suffered as a result of being wrongly told that she had breast cancer. 'There are also very serious patient safety concerns about the ""mix-up"" and how the other patients have potentially been affected too.' She said aside from the 'obvious physical implications', the ordeal has had 'a devastating impact' on her client's life. Ms Dawes had worked as a breast care nurse in the Oncology Department at New Cross Hospital but has since found herself unable to continue in her role 'as a consequence of what she has been through'. Ms Hawkley added: 'It is also vital that the Trust identifies what improvements can be made to ensure that this never happens again to improve patient safety at the hospital.' A trust spokesman told MailOnline it has apologised to Ms Dawes and carried out a full investigation. He said: 'The medical director and nurse director met with Ms Dawes to offer her an unreserved apology for this terrible error and inform her of the trust’s investigation into the incident. 'The findings of the investigation were shared with Ms Dawes and a further apology offered at that time. 'The incident is now part of an ongoing legal claim with which the trust is co-operating fully. 'The trust can confirm that no other patient received inappropriate treatment as a result of this incident.' The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability and a spokesman said an apology had been issued to Ms Dawes. He added no other patient received inappropriate treatment . </document> <Summary> A nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she'd never had the disease.

"<document> Christine Carriage, 67, (pictured) was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Norwich Crown Court . A grandmother hoarded 1,300 items of stolen clothing in her tiny bungalow – which police said was like a ‘warehouse’. Officers raiding Christine Carriage’s one-bedroom home found that 340 of the stolen items still had price tags on. But this week the 67-year-old walked free from court. A total of 1,337 items of clothing, shoes and handbags – valued at £5,620 – were seized by police from the home in Bowthorpe, Norwich, on November 4, 2013. William Carter, prosecuting, said police found an 8ft-long clothes rail bending under the huge weight of the clothing in one room. He said: ‘The officers described the property as looking more like a clothing warehouse than a dwelling. Each room was packed.’ On Wednesday, Carriage admitted acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. When police searched the house, she was at the property with son Shane Carriage, 45, and grandson Luke Hall. Officers found cash, drug paraphernalia and at least an eighth of a kilo of cocaine. Carriage had convictions for dishonesty from the 1960s and 1970s, and two convictions for shoplifting in the 1980s, as well as one in 1996 and another in 2012. Philippa Page, defending, said some items were Carriage’s clothes and those of her son, grandson and late husband. She said Carriage was guilty of mistaken family loyalty in allowing her ‘increasingly out-of-control’ grandson to store stolen clothes at her home. Sentencing Carriage, Judge Maureen Bacon told her: ‘You have been a dishonest woman through all your life. 'I don’t see why I should inflict your keep on the public purse by sending you to prison today.’ She was given a suspended six-month jail sentence, ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and told to pay an £80 victim surcharge at Norwich Crown Court. But Carriage and her son were cleared of supplying cocaine last August after Recorder Peter Wallis ruled there was no case to answer. Hall had previously admitted supplying cocaine, possessing cocaine and possessing criminal property and was jailed for 34 months.

"<document> Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, the NRC reviewed license applications for, and oversaw the construction, startup, and operation of, more than 100 commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States. Beginning in the 1980s and extending to today, the NRC also reviewed new plant designs and plans to increase the power output of operating reactors.

"<document> Millions of point of sales systems are vulnerable to security breaches as they are protected by the same default password - used by a global maker of payment devices for more than two decades, researches say. The password, 166816, is still being used by about 90 per cent of customers, researchers David Byrne and Charles Henderson disclosed on Wednesday during the annual RSA security conference in California. Henderson said that the unidentified vendor had been using the same default password since at least 1990, according to The Register. Researchers Charles Henderson (right) and David Byrne (left) said a global maker of cash registers has been using the same default password on the payment devices for more than two decades. This potentailly puts the devices at risk of being a target of a security breach . 'Nine out of 10 times when we see equipment from that manufacturer, 90 per cent of the time, this is the password,' he said. 'I actually saw this password really recently on a different manufacturer's device [by a customer] who thought the password was unique to them.' Hackers would need physical access to the payment devices, opening a panel of the device using a paperclip, to exploit it, according to The Register. This type of attack is uncommon and reportedly easy for malicious staff. For example, during the conference it was revealed that two individuals reportedly entered a major American retail store, unscrewed a server rack and walked out with the server leaving the store unable to process credit card payments, according to RT. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor using the 166816 password,  a Google search pointed to Verifone which connects around 27 million payment devices around the world, according to RT. On Thursday, Verifone said in a statement that all of its devices in the field came with the same default password, Z66831, according to CSO. The company also said the password can be found on the Internet with instructions for programming terminals. However, Verifone claimed sensitive payment information or personally identifiable information cannot be captured, even though the password has become known over the years. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor, a Google search pointed to Verifone (file photo of one of the company's payment devices) The company said: 'What the password allows someone to do is to configure some settings on the terminal; all executables have to be file signed, and it is not possible to enter malware just by knowing passwords.' Its new products come with a 'pre-expired' password that has to be changed during installation set up, according to Verifone, and the company also said it encourages customers to change the default password, reported CSO. As retailers have increasingly battled security breaches in recent years, Target was at the center of the second-largest card breach at a U.S. retailer two years ago. An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70million of Target's customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking into Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines. The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip - including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine. All of the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks. In another case of a security breach, in 2014, 56million debit and credit cards are estimated to have been breached in a data theft between April and September at Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada. </document> <Summary> Millions of point of sales systems are vulnerable to security breaches as they are protected by the same default password - used by a global maker of payment devices for more than two decades, researches say.

"<document> Event Summary What role did education play in the 2014 midterm elections, and what’s next for education policymakers wishing to implement reform at the state and federal levels? Two days after the GOP’s victory, AEI’s education department hosted a panel discussion addressing how states will take the lead on education, and feel emboldened to do so, post-2014. AEI’s Rick Hess began by noting the evolving role of the states and federal government, predicting that the US Department of Education will now face considerable difficulty in convincing states to buy into President Obama’s waiver-heavy approach. Education Week’s Alyson Klein agreed that the Common Core and teacher evaluation reforms have been marked with the “Obama stamp,” although this could change in the future. Jeanne Allen of the Center for Education Reform continued by claiming that the elections will give Americans with reasonable objections to the Common Core the opportunity to voice their concerns. Democrats for Education Reform’s Charles Barone then turned to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), predicting an ESEA reauthorization in the new Congress, while Bethany Little of the Education Counsel noted that such legislative action will be impossible if leaders come to the table with only their party’s agenda in mind. Looking ahead, Hess predicted that education policy could play a greater role in 2016 than it did in 2014 if the issues register more for voters than matters such as foreign policy. On issues such as prekindergarten, he expressed how Republicans have a critical opportunity to speak to the concerns of American families and what’s best for their children. –Elizabeth English Event Description The 2014 midterm elections are quickly approaching, with big implications for K–12 schools and higher education institutions around the country. More than 40 states are currently rolling out the Common Core State Standards, teacher tenure lawsuits have been filed in California and New York, and the Obama administration recently announced a $250 million grant program to create and expand prekindergarten initiatives. In the postsecondary education realm, Democrats and Republicans alike have introduced bills to reform college repayment plans. During a time of politicized education debates ranging from curriculum and standards to early-childhood education, what will the midterm election results mean for state and federal education policies? Two days after the elections, we welcome you to join us at AEI for a balanced discussion of state education initiatives, federal spending, and what the future may hold for policymakers wishing to implement education reform at the state and federal levels. </document> <Summary> The 2014 midterm elections are quickly approaching, with big implications for K–12 schools and higher education institutions around the country.

"<document> Building on the preceding discussion of mechanisms, this section assesses the specific current ways in which U.S. oil dependence could reduce its security; the following section considers the implications of other states’ oil dependence for U.S. security. Some of the mechanism do not come into play here—the United States is not vulnerable to a major power cutting access to its oil and undermining its military capability; nor does the United States need to pursue military policies to protect its access to oil that would threaten a major power and fuel a security dilemma. Instead, protection of the U.S. economy underpins the key scenarios in which the United States might use force. This section explores three prosperity-based possibilities: 1) Iranian closing of the Strait of Hormuz requires U.S. intervention; 2) a cutoff of Saudi oil requires U.S. intervention; and 3) an energy-driven NATO alliance with Georgia increases the probability of conflict with Russia. In addition, the section reviews the arguments about the relationship between U.S. oil dependence and the threat posed by al Qaeda. Intervening to protect U.S. prosperity—Iran and the Strait of Hormuz Energy dependence could draw the United States into a conflict in which a regional power was interrupting, or threatening to interrupt, the flow of oil. The economic costs of a disruption would determine whether the costs of fighting were justified. Similarly, the potential economic costs of a disruption would determine whether U.S. foreign and military policy should be devoted to deterring states from interrupting the flow of oil; more precisely, these economic costs would determine how much the United States should invest in the policies required for deterrence. Given the geographical distribution of oil, such a conflict would likely occur in the Persian Gulf. The greatest danger is probably posed by Iran—the Iraq War has greatly increased Iran’s power relative to Iraq, and Iran is acquiring improved missile capabilities and making progress toward having the capability to build nuclear weapons. The most disruptive Iranian action would be closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which the vast majority of Persian Gulf oil must pass. Having identified the danger posed by dependence on oil that transits this strait (as well as the Strait of Malacca), a recent Council on Foreign Relations study concluded that the “United States should take the lead in building an infrastructure protection program that would be based on practical steps by relevant countries and address critical infrastructures and transit routes. Initial efforts should focus on joint planning, technical assistance, and military exercises, especially involving naval units operating near ports or along critical sea-lanes.” Although difficult to estimate the probability that Iran would attempt to close the strait, analysts have offered reasons for expecting the probability to be quite low: Iran would lose the oil revenue from its own exports; and Iran would likely be deterred by the probable costs of U.S. intervention, which could include the destruction of key military bases and occupation of some of its territory. Because so much oil flows through the strait, the United States would almost certainly respond to keep it open. Nevertheless, there are plausible scenarios in which Iran blocks the strait, for example, as retaliation for an attack against is nuclear weapons program or as a coercive measure if losing a conventional war. Careful analysis suggests that the United States would prevail, but that a successful campaign could take many weeks or more, and that oil prices would increase significantly during this period. Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would increase the risk of this scenario in two basic ways. First, Iran might believe that the possibility of escalation to nuclear weapons would deter the United States from responding, making Iran more willing to interrupt tanker traffic. Although basic deterrence logic says this calculation points in the correct direction, the United States might nevertheless intervene. The United States would question Iran’s willingness to escalate to nuclear use because America’s far larger and more capable nuclear forces would pose a formidable retaliatory threat. In addition, the United States would have incentives to make clear that possession of a small number of nuclear weapons by a much weaker state would not deter the United States from using conventional weapons in a limited war. Being deterred by the Iranian nuclear force would suggest that small nuclear arsenals provide tremendous potential for launching conventional aggression. As Barry Posen argued in a related context (the counterfactual case in which Iraq possessed nuclear weapons before deciding to invade Kuwait), “If the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait is permitted to stand, nuclear weapons will come to be viewed as a shield that protects conventional conquests from any challenger, including a great power heavily armed with its own nuclear weapons.” Consequently, the United States would have incentives to respond to Iranian aggression both to preserve its ability to deter conventional aggression by small nuclear states and to support its nonproliferation policy. Second, once a conventional conflict occurred, there would be the danger that U.S. conventional operations could increase the probability nuclear war. A number of paths are possible. The U.S. mine clearing operation required to open the strait would likely be accompanied by attacks against land-based Iranian targets. The United States would want to destroy the land-based anti-ship cruise missiles that Iran could use to threaten U.S. mine clearing ships; in addition, the United States would want to destroy Iranian air defenses that could be used to protect these missiles. These U.S. strikes would require large numbers of carrier-based aircraft flying sorties over a period of a few weeks or more. If Iran lacked confidence that U.S. aims were limited, it could feel compelled to put its nuclear forces on alert to increase their survivability, which would increase the probability of accidental or unauthorized nuclear attack. The United States could then have incentives to attack Iran’s nuclear force, either preemptively because it believed Iran was preparing to launch an attack or preventively because it faced a closing window of opportunity after which Iran’s nuclear forces would be survivable. A more subtle danger is the possibility of inadvertent nuclear escalation resulting from a situation in which Iranian leaders decide to escalate because they believe, incorrectly, that the United States has decided to destroy their nuclear force (or ability to launch it). U.S. conventional operations could create this danger by destroying Iranian radars, and command and control systems, leaving Iranian leaders unable to assess the U.S. conventional campaign and fearing that the United States was preparing to launch a full-scale invasion or a conventional attack against their nuclear forces. </document> <Summary> Building on the preceding discussion of mechanisms, this section assesses the specific current ways in which U.S. oil dependence could reduce its security.

"<document> (CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is ""service of process""? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go ""off the grid"". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is ""nail and mail"" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of ""service"" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, ""traditional"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good.""  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be ""liked"" by all your gawking ""friends,"" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we ""live"" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email. </document> <Summary> (CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook.

"<document> China has created a large and modern navy, which, at the present rate will, by 2020, be substantially larger than America’s. Its vessels are highly capable and armed with long-range, advanced, anti-ship missiles and air-defense missiles. China is upgrading its nuclear arsenal and is on track to more than double the number of nuclear warheads capable of striking the U.S. homeland over the next few years. They already have the world’s largest and most lethal inventory of conventional ballistic missiles as well as large numbers of highly capable and long-range ground, air and sea-based cruise missiles. They will continue to expand, diversify, and improve their missile inventory, enhancing their ability to coerce or use force against the United States and its allies and partners in Asia. China now is able to threaten U.S. bases and operating areas throughout the region, including those that it previously could not reach with conventional weapons, such as Anderson Air Force Base on Guam. They have almost 2,000 capable fighter aircraft and are on track to introduce two new fifth-generation fighters, which they will likely add to their inventory between 2017 and 2019. China also appears to be developing a new long-range stealth bomber. China is significantly upgrading its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and improving amphibious capabilities. According to the Defense Science Board, China already has offensive cyber capabilities that can inflict existential damage – damage comparable to that caused by a nuclear exchange – on America’s critical infrastructure and upon our society. The best way to think of the Chinese buildup is this: they are constructing a missile-centric military to take advantage of an asymmetric vulnerability of the United States. That’s the result of a lesson they learned almost 20 years ago. In fact, China is already triggering confrontations; the shift in the balance of power – the growing ability of China to exploit America’s asymmetric vulnerability – is already affecting China’s calculations in the East and South China Seas. China claims sovereignty over virtually the entirety of those seas and the island formations in them. In the South China Sea, for example, their claims, illustrated by their infamous “nine-dash” line, encompasses Taiwan, and extend virtually to the shores of the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei, and also include waters legitimately claimed by Indonesia. This is not some small matter. The South China Sea is twice the size of Alaska. Some of the most important shipping lanes pass through these waters. Petroleum reserves beneath these waters may equal half of Saudi Arabia’s proven reserves. To enforce these claims, China unilaterally exercises the rights of a sovereign, presenting its neighbors with the choice of either acceding de facto to its claims or starting a shooting war with a regionally dominant military power that has a large, modern navy and a tremendous missile arsenal looming in the background. The first is economic and strategic. China wants unfettered access to the resources in its near seas and control over its strategic environment. Another is nationalistic and historical. China has historically been the “middle kingdom” in Asia. That’s how they view themselves. And what does that mean? It means that Chinese leaders believe that the countries along their periphery should be in various stages of vassalage to China. It’s important to understand the broader implications of this view. A Japanese scholar once said to me that “whereas we [the democratic countries] view the world horizontally, China views the world vertically – with China at the top of the food chain. In such a world, there is no equality; there is no rule of law. Since World War II, the United States and its allies have created an international system that fosters, however imperfectly, a) free and equal access to the seas, air, space, and cyberspace, b) neutral rules governing trade, and c) the resolution of disputes according to accepted norms, where smaller countries are at no disadvantage. It’s sometimes referred to as a “norm-based international system.” China’s leaders have accepted the benefits of such a system to facilitate their ascent, but resist complying with the restrictions; they see the world as one where “the big dogs get the benefits” within their respective spheres of influence, and they view Asia, or East Asia at least, as their sphere. </document> <Summary> China has created a large and modern navy, which, at the present rate will, by 2020, be substantially larger than America’s.

"<document> MOSCOW — In American presidential politics, high oil prices are a problem. For Vladimir V. Putin’s new presidential term in Russia, they will be a necessity — crucial to fulfilling his campaign promises to lift government spending by billions of dollars a year. Related Times Topic: Vladimir Putin Add to Portfolio Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Pool photo by Alexei Druzhinin Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaking in Kemerovo, Russia. The reality of his ambitious spending proposals is setting in. But doing that without busting the Kremlin’s budget would require oil to reach and sustain a price it has never yet achieved — $150 a barrel, according to one estimate by Citigroup. No wonder economists who specialize in Russia are skeptical. (On Friday, Russia’s Ural Blend export-grade oil was trading at $120 on the global spot market.) “It’s very hard to overestimate how vulnerable the Russian economy is to external pressures” from the oil price, Sergei Guriev, the rector of the New Economic School in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. “That vulnerability is huge, which is why Russia must be very vigilant. The spending is a risk.” The promised spending is also ambitious. Mr. Putin has laid out a program of raising wages for doctors and teachers, padding retirement checks for everyone and refurbishing Russia’s military arsenal. The oil-lubricated offerings would even include a population premium: expanding the popular “baby bonus” payments the Russian government provides to mothers, to include a third child. The payment, of up to $8,300 for housing or baby-related expenses, now comes as an incentive only with each of the first two children. The additional cost of the expanded baby benefits alone will total $4.6 billion a year, according to an estimate by the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Most of Mr. Putin’s spending promises came at least partly in response to the street demonstrations by young and middle-class protesters in Moscow and other big cities challenging his authority in the weeks leading up to the March 4 election. His apparent aim was to shore up support from the rest of Russia: poorer and rural parts of the country, and from state workers and the elderly. The repercussions of his campaign promises, and an earlier commitment on military spending, could be felt for years to come, giving price swings in oil a bigger role than ever on the Russian economy. Taxes on oil and natural gas sales provide half of Russia’s government revenue. Each increase in the Russian budget equivalent to 1 percent of the gross domestic product requires a rise in the price of oil of about $10 a barrel on global markets — which is how Citigroup arrived at the $150-a-barrel figure for meeting the new obligations Mr. Putin has taken on. Analysts worry that, even if the government can fulfill its promises, too little will remain for a sovereign wealth fund that is intended as a shock absorber for the Russian economy and the ruble exchange rate . Russia needed to use that buffer as recently as 2008, during the financial crisis. “The concern is simple,” Kingsmill Bond, the chief strategist at Citigroup in Russia, said in a telephone interview. “If the oil price that Russia requires to balance its budget is higher, the systemic risks that the market faces are also higher.” The bank estimated that Mr. Putin’s promises of higher wages and pensions, not counting the military outlays, add up to additional spending equal to 1.5 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product. That comes on top of an earlier pledge to spend an additional 3 percent of gross domestic product a year re-arming the military. In all, the new commitments would add up to about $98 billion a year, Citigroup estimates. The spillover from the Arab Spring and the specter of an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear development plants are propping up oil prices now. But over the long term, economic stagnation in Europe could help bring them down. Even before the election, Russia’s government spending was up, helping reinforce Mr. Putin’s message that he was the best candidate to deliver prosperity and stability. In January, the Russian military ministry, for example, doubled salaries in the nation’s million-person army. It was ostensibly a long-planned move. But coming just two months before the presidential vote, the political message was clear. Also smoothing the path for Mr. Putin’s victory was a national cap on utility rates that helped keep inflation at the lowest level in Russia’s post-Soviet history for January and February, at a 3.7 percent annual pace. “Putin made large spending commitments,” the Fitch rating agency said in a statement released the day after the election. “The current high price of oil cushions Russia’s public finances,” Fitch said. “But in the absence of fiscal tightening that significantly cuts the non-oil and gas fiscal deficit, a severe and sustained drop in the oil price would have a damaging impact on the Russian economy and public finances and would likely lead to a downgrade” of the nation’s credit rating. As Mr. Putin’s spending promises started to be introduced in January, Fitch altered Russia’s outlook to stable, from positive. Mr. Putin has defended the proposed spending as necessary and just, given the hardship of teachers and other public sector workers in the post-Soviet years. “A doctor, a teacher, a professor, these people should make enough money where they work so they don’t have to look for a side job,” Mr. Putin wrote in a manifesto published during the campaign. But in fact, the government will offset a portion of the pay raises, perhaps as much as one-third of their cost, by laying off some public sector workers and trimming some other public spending. That was the word from Lev I. Yakobson, the deputy rector of the Higher School of Economics, who helped draft the policy. That part of the plan, though, was never part of Mr. Putin’s stump speech. </document> <Summary> MOSCOW — In American presidential politics, high oil prices are a problem.

"<document> The look that the native turns on the settler's town is a look of lust, a look of envy; it expresses his dreams of possessionöall manner of possession: to sit at the settler's table, to sleep in the settler's bed, with his wife if possible. The colonized man is an envious man. And this the settler knows very well; when their glances meet he ascertains bitterly, always on the defensive `They want to take our place'. It is true, for there is no native who does not dream at least once a day of setting himself up in the settler's place'' ([1961] 1967, page 30). Numerous authors have theorised about the intersection of possession, sexuality, urbanism and race (for example Low, 1996). The machinic geography of phenotype, however, takes issue with the Hegelian self/other scheme that supports much of this work, and studies instead how certain bodies stick to certain spaces, how they are chained by hunger, cold, darkness, mud, poverty, crime, glances full of envy and anxiety. The segregation between colonists and colonised is the apparently binary result of many nitty-gritty material processes which, when analysed, render it a lot less binary. This also means race is devious in inventing new ways of chaining bodies. Race is creative, constantly morphing, now disguised as sexual desire, now as la mission civilatrice, all the while weaving new elements in its wake. Deleuze and Guattari might say that what defines race is not rigidity or inevitability, but its ``lines of flight''. Race can be as stark as apartheid, but mostly it is fuzzy and operates through something else. The social sciences literature on race (urban geography, postcolonial theory, film studies) remains relevant from the machinic perspective. Race is shown to exist through ghettoes, travel writing, and Hollywood cinema. What this literature shows is precisely race's plastic, emergent, and more-than-human spatiality (for example, Anderson, 1991; hooks, 1992; Jackson and Penrose, 1993; Jacobs, 1996; Robinson, 1996). Still, more geographical and anthropological work needs to be done to theorise the biocultural imbrications of race. For example, in the introduction to the collection Race, Nature and the Politics of Difference it is argued that ––both race and nature are historical artefacts: assemblages of material, discourse, and practice irreducible to a single timeless essence. By charting the ways in which race and nature work together, and by tracing key disruptions in their busy traffic, we emphasize the cultural labors required to maintain them as they are. ... We write against racismsönot against `race' but against the exclusionary effects pro- duced through its invocation, deployment, and reproduction'' (Moore et al, 2003, page 42). But the full implications of the term assemblageöthat it includes biological and other nonhuman forcesöstill need to be explored. There is some work being done that quietly disrespects the disciplinary boundaries of modern epistemology. Anthropolog- ically inclined medical research has the potential to offer a critical approach to the biocultural aspects of racial division (Wade, 2002, pages 117 ^ 122). Luca Cavalli-Sforza maps human migration using genetics and physical anthropology as well as archae- ology, linguistics, and history (Cavalli-Sforza et al, 1994). This research deserves theoretical attention, so that more rigorous studies of the discursive, technological, and economic embeddedness of phenotype can be imagined. Zack (2002) has recently argued that physical anthropology can only account for variation through heredity, not the folk (taxonomic) conception of race as such. She therefore continues to define `race' as an essentialist social construction which has no basis in the science of phenotype. What is needed, however, is to highjack the folk conception and rethink race as culturally embedded phenotype. Saying that race has no basis in biology is different from saying that phenotype plays some role in racial differentiation. Pheno- type is a crucial element in the assemblage called race, and, because phenotype is already nondiscrete and shaped by culture, race cannot be an essentialist concept. Now, what does this nonessentialism mean to antiracist politics? </document> <Summary> to sit at the settler's table, to sleep in the settler's bed, with his wife if possible.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President. In September, the city council passed an amendment to the sale, a comprehensive plan to change the name of single family zones to neighborhood residential zones to better reflect the reality of these zones, which already include many backyard cottages, detached houses that are home to multiple families and legacy duplexes and triplexes that pre-date our

Speaker 2: Again, there are no changes to zoning within this bill. We are required to amend the comprehensive plan before we can change the land use code. So just like in September, the legislation does change the underlying. It does change the zoning name.

Speaker 3: And the name Single Family Designation solely does not yield the truly diverse nature of what our neighborhoods are as we seek to have robust discussion with community members going forward. I want to also thank Erin House and I know you did a tremendous amount of work.

"<document> Row: Tinie Tempah pictured performing at an 'intimate gig' in Canterbury last night, where he arrived late and then played just two songs . Fans of rapper Tinie Tempah were left furious when the star turned up hours late to his own 'intimate gig' and only performed two songs before leaving. Music lovers paid nearly £40 to see the singer perform in Canterbury last night - only to wait for more than three hours for him to arrive. He then spent just a few minutes on stage, playing two of his songs before telling the crowd 'See you on tour' and leaving. The club which hosted the event has apologised to the audience and accused Tinie of breaking his contract with them. The event was advertised as 'an exclusive and intimate gig with one of Britain's most talented performers', with tickets starting at £30 plus booking fees. Some fans are believed to have paid more than £100 to meet Tinie, 26, whose real name is Patrick Okogwu and who is best known for his 2010 hit Pass Out. Ticket-holders had been warned that they would not be let in if they arrived after 11pm - even though Tinie was not there until at least three hours later. One member of the audience told MailOnline that she stormed out in disgust when the star failed to turn up until after 2am, and then stayed in a VIP area meeting fans for another hour. 'We were told we needed to be there by 11, but he didn't turn up until well past two,' said the 20-year-old student, who did not want to be named. 'Me and my friend left after three and he still hadn't played. 'We weren't the only people who left early, a lot of people left. People weren't happy.' Fans who stayed for the late-night performance were treated to just two songs before Tinie walked off stage, telling the audience: 'See you on tour.' Venue: Bosses at Club Chemistry said they would seek a refund from Tinie's management . One ticket-holder wrote on Twitter today: 'Clearly success doesn't equal class, Tinie Tempah showed how little he cares about his fans in Canterbury last night.' She added: 'He didn't deliver on his promises to the club, half-heartedly performed two songs rather than a full set then left.' A spokesman for Club Chemistry told MailOnline that Tinie had breached his contract for the event - and claimed that at one point he threatened not to play a single song. 'We have never been so utterly let down or disappointed by someone we were so excited about,' she said. 'There was nothing we could do. At one stage his manager actually told us he was not going to perform at all!' Success: Tinie Tempah pictured in 2011 after winning two Brit awards for his debut album . Organisers apologised to those who had bought tickets, saying in a statement: 'We are as disappointed as you. We were promised a two hour set with DJ Charlesy that included a decent performance from Tinie Tempah, as well as meet, greet and photos. 'It was all a massive let-down. We have lodged a formal complaint with his management and have demanded your ticket money back. 'Club Chemistry is committed to delivering quality artists and entertainment and it would appear that some people are not as dedicated to the cause as we are.' The club said that it would make sure members of the audience are 'compensated' and promised to keep them updated. Representatives for Tinie Tempah failed to return a request for comment on the row. </document> <Summary> Fans of rapper Tinie Tempah were left furious when the star turned up hours late to his own 'intimate gig' and only performed two songs before leaving.

"<document> These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams. The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a Jack Russell's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer Pauline Kidner. Nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food. Scroll down for video . The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried by a dog - are doing better . Nursed originally on milk, custard creams were introduced to see whether the cubs were ready for food . 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe,' Pauline said . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at the Secret World centre, but Pauline, who runs charity Secret World, says they're growing at an astonishing rate. The 65-year-old, from Somerset, said: 'When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g, now they're 1.1kg, you can almost see them growing.' 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe, we can't risk any getting in their lungs, but they're now on normal bottles. 'Little Star came from Derbyshire, she was brought into someone's kitchen by their Jack Russell dog, it was very lucky he didn't hurt her, she'd been born two days earlier; her umbilical was still attached . 'The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . Pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual. 'One cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set,' she said. The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so it died within 24 hours . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre . Jack Russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting. However, there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood-sport was to blame for the death of this cub. 'Then we had another called Vogue come up from Cornwall, we called her that because was picked up in the village Vogue near Redruth,' Pauline said. 'Then lastly the third came in three weeks ago, that one's from near Cheddar in Somerset, we called him Scrumpy, because of the cider context . When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg . They're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, then they might be moved on to solids by the carers . 'We've been keeping Scrumpy separate as he's older than the two girls. Once they start to mouth things, they start playing with each other, pulling ears, Scrumpy can get a bit rough though.' 'They're still on bottles now, we've started putting in custard creams to see if they're interested, then we might move them on to solids. 'They're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now.' The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.' 'Sadly if we can't release them, we do have to put them to sleep, which is why we reduce human contact like that.' After they move to their nocturnal sleep rhythm they will be put in glass enclosures and then released . </document> <Summary> These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams.

"<document> This week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided seven Mississippi food processing plants and arrested 680 workers for immigration violations. The moral cost of these raids to our shared humanity is apparent in stories like that of a tearful 13-year-old boy waving goodbye to his mother or an 11-year old girl pleading for her father’s release. But some people might feel differently, believing such scenes are just the cost of enforcing our immigration laws. If that’s you, I urge you to weigh another cost instead: the sheer financial expense of such cruelty. First, there’s lost income. ICE was created in 2003 to “protect national security and public safety after 9/11,” but this week’s raids were not about security or safety or terrorism. They targeted immigrants while they worked to support their families and our economy. Many of the arrested individuals now leave behind jobs that won’t be filled and children and spouses who now live without a family member and their associated income. Their communities and local businesses will suffer down the line. And state and local governments will lose the associated tax revenues; undocumented workers pay an estimated $12 billion a year in taxes. Then there are the costs of enforcement and detention. ICE Acting Director Matt Albence admitted that the raids required a yearlong investigation and 600 agents to execute. The 680 arrested individuals now languish in detention facilities. According to ICE, the average daily cost of detaining one person is $134. Some estimates place the cost at closer to $200 per day. Given this administration’s immigration policies, from family separation to zero tolerance to mass raids, the number of immigrants in detention is rapidly expanding, not retracting. For every person who leaves detention, another replaces them, if not two. Even using ICE’s conservative figure of $134, the cost of keeping one immigrant in detention is almost $50,000 per year. The detention expense alone for the group detained on Wednesday is approximately $100,000 a day, $3 million per month, and $36 million a year. Given that more raids are coming, these costs are only going to go up. There is yet another cost: Raids add to the immigration court backlog. According to Syracuse University, the number of cases pending in immigration courts is close to 1 million and ballooning by the day. Under the Trump administration, this number has nearly doubled in just 2½ years, and the average wait for an immigration hearing is now more than two years. Detention centers holding people awaiting their time in immigration court have exceeded their capacity, which necessitates the use of private prisons, whose owners made record campaign donations in the past election cycle. Last year alone, taxpayers paid almost $1 billion to the private prison complex for immigration detention. Meanwhile, private prisons have minimal oversight and harsh conditions that resemble slave labor. The result is an increasing number of immigrants caught up in the detention system, a larger immigration court backlog, a financial incentive to keep immigrants in detention longer, and correspondingly higher cost to taxpayers. The truth is that no government has unlimited resources. When choosing how to spend public funds, we need to weigh costs and benefits. This administration has decided to spend countless time and money arresting nonviolent workers who take care of their families and their communities while spending little or nothing on combating domestic terrorism and white nationalism. CNN reported this week that the Department of Homeland Security sought to increase its focus on domestic terrorism but was rebuffed by the White House. Meanwhile, two gunmen killed 31 people in Dayton and El Paso last weekend — yet another cost of this administration’s immigration policies. ICE officials are boasting that the workplace raids in Mississippi were the largest in over a decade. That is nothing to brag about. Beyond the countless families and lives torn apart in these operations and mass arrests, the time and financial resources necessary to execute them are wasteful and unnecessary. These raids are merely a show to fire up an anti-immigrant base — and a costly show at that. </document> <Summary> This week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided seven Mississippi food processing plants and arrested 680 workers for immigration violations.

"<document> Unfortunately, this is due to the fact that most people do not recognize that the Caribbean is a gateway for two of the highest-priority security issues in the United States: drug trafficking and energy dependence. While the doomsday scenario of nuclear war in the Middle East is highly provocative, security in the Caribbean may have a greater effect on the everyday lives of Americans. The Keystone Pipeline Project received so much attention, not solely because of the potential for job creation with the project, but because of its potential to provide another reliable source of foreign energy. Any security threat in the Caribbean could pose a grave threat to currently reliable sources of foreign energy.

Perhaps an even more jarring statistic to drive home this point is that about 64 percent of all energy imports pass through the Caribbean Sea before they reach American refineries on the Gulf Coast.

#Person2#: Hello, Professor Webster, this is Janet Wang calling. I'm living two doors down from your teaching assistant, Ken Williams. Ken asked me to call you because he has lost his voice and can't talk to you himself.
#Person1#: Lost his voice? Oh, what a shame! Is there anything I can do for you?
#Person2#: Well, Ken has a class this afternoon from two-thirty to four and he won't be able to teach it, but he doesn't want to cancel it either.
#Person1#: Want me to try to find somebody else to teach the class?
#Person2#: No, not exactly. What he wants to do is to get someone to go in for him, just to pass back the midterm exams. He's already marked them and they are on the desk in his office. The whole thing wouldn't take more than ten minutes.
#Person1#: His classes are two-thirty, eh? Well, I'm afraid at that time I'll be on campus anyway; so I can do it for him.
#Person2#: Thank you very much, Professor Webster. </document> <Summary> Ken Williams, a teaching assistant, has lost his voice and can't teach his class this afternoon.

"<document> WHY THE STATES MATTER -- States have earned their reputations as laboratories for a reason. With greater discretion over their budgets, wide latitude in acting on health care and education, and a proximity to constituents that makes reform easier than it is in the insulated Beltway, state legislators are well positioned to institute policies to make a difference in people's lives. Consider this: State and local revenue is equal to 16.2 percent of GDP. State courts handle 17 million civil cases a year. State employment law lays the baseline of worker rights for millions of Americans. States house 1.9 million prisoners, more than ten times the prison population at the federal level. And state publicemployee pensions manage trillions in assets. While the federal government dedicates billions to health care and education programs, the way the money is spent is often determined not in Congress, but in state legislatures. In other words, whether the issue is criminal law, tort law, workplace issues, classrooms or health care, states are the critical battlegrounds. And with a handful of Northeastern states and California embracing real global-warming reforms, these local moves are pushing the issue along at the national level. A hike in the minimum wage -- now one of the highest priority issues for the new Congress -- gained steam after being pushed through legislature after legislature last session and getting a mandate from voters in six states who approved cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. With D.C. talking about fixing Medicare Part D, a number of states have already made bold moves with prescription drugs, including innovative cost-savings measures in Oregon, Maine and elsewhere that have served to remind voters and the press that Americans don't have to settle for legislation written by pharmaceutical lobbyists during a time of record industry profits. States don't just produce leading issues; they also produce leaders. In 2006, a number of the most inspiring and successful candidates for U.S. Senate -- Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester, Amy Klobuchar, and Claire McCaskill -- cut their teeth in state and local government. In the next two years, states will have an opportunity to continue their leadership, and in more states than ever, progressives will be poised at the fore. Make no mistake, corporate America understands the power of statehouses. While Washington lobbyists have reined supreme for the last twelve years, BusinessWeek has reported that lobbyists are setting their sights on the statehouses as a result of the newly hostile landscape in Washington. If progressives are going to prevent November's gains from being anything but Pyrrhic victories, it is incumbent upon us to be ready to take key policy fights to the states. PROGRESSIVE STRENGTH IN THE STATES -- Prior to the 2006 election, Democrats controlled the â€œtrifectaâ€? -- both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office -- in eight states. That number has since risen to fifteen. But the numbers are slightly misleading: Some of these states are very narrowly held or are effectively in the control of conservative Democrats. But these numbers also understate progressive performance in key ways. In Washington and Colorado, Democratic majorities previously held hostage by one or two conservative members swelled in size, with the November vote, improving their ability to move legislation. In California, Governor Arn..old Schwarzenegger, although less than perfect, has shown a willingness to cooperate on some key progressive issues. In Minnesota, the Democratic gains in the legislature were very significant, increasing the likelihood that progressives will be able to override vetoes from the conservative governor. In New York, the Working Families Party, through its cross-endorsement strategy, has fostered key relationships with Republicans in the GOP-held Senate. In virtually every state in the nation, progressives enter the 2007 legislative cycle in a better position than they did two years ago. That means that they can pass more good bills and defeat more bad ones than has been possible for a very long time. Fortunately, progressives also have an agenda to put in place in the states. A WINNING AGENDA -- The minimum wage won big in every state where it was on the ballot. America wants a raise. But the minimum wage is just a beginning. A real progressive agenda will increase democracy, strengthen communities and families, ensure that work is rewarded, and find new economic-growth strategies. By cutting across single-issue divides, a progressive agenda can inspire the country and unite people who would not otherwise find common ground. </document> <Summary> WHY THE STATES MATTER -- States have earned their reputations as laboratories for a reason.

Hello. Dave Chappelle. Just very briefly, I'm looking forward to seeing how this point in the budget process evolves next year and every two year increments through 2030. And how we manage as a city, what happens after the Olympics and really looking at the Century Foundation as kind of a guide to doing it right the first time yet 
Hi, this is Corliss Lee. And looking at the budget where we're planning on furloughs, layoffs and salary cuts for frontline city employees to balance the budget. I'm having a hard time reconciling some of the other moves that are made.

"<document> Speaker 5: The report Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development and Arts Committee. Agenda Item one Capital 11958 4,000,000,002 residential rental properties conforming to Zell Miller code with changes in state law. The committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 1: Just remember Herbold.
Speaker 5: Fantastic. Thank you. So back in February of 2019, I sponsored Resolution 31861 that proposed certain legislative changes originating from recommendations from the Women's Commission in the Housing Justice Project Report Losing Home. The recommendations in the report identified specific harms in our eviction system, impacting tenants in marginalized communities, particularly women, the African-American community, seniors and transpeople.
Speaker 5: Following up on Resolution 31861, passed unanimously by the Council in the 2019 state legislative session, advocates at the state level and housing champions were in were successful in passing changes to the Residential Landlord Tenant Act Senate Bill 5600 was sponsored by Senators Patty Couteur and Mona Das and House Bill 1440, sponsored by Representatives Jordan Robertson and Nicole
Speaker 5: Macri. These bills have been in effect since the end of July and SDI, the Department of Construction Inspections, is already conducting outreach and education on the changes in this bill. They've been working to notify landlords who are currently registered with the rental registration and inspection database, about 19,000 landlords, and they've been incorporating into future landlord trainings and
Speaker 5: curriculum the new requirements under state law. This harmonization bill that is before us today makes consistent with our own unique city laws the new rights granted to tenants by state law. It passed unanimously out of the August 13th Civil Rights Utility's Economic Development and Arts Committee.
Speaker 5: What the legislation does is three primary things. First, it extends what was a mere three days that tenants had to pay rent or face eviction, for which they a reason for not paying the rent would not be accepted by a judge is only looks at whether or not the rent was paid within three days.
Speaker 5: The new law gives tenants 14 days for nonpayment of rent. This extends the amount of time a tenant has to access services, support or the next pay period in order to potentially get up, get caught up and avoid eviction proceedings.
Speaker 5: Secondly, the bill redefines rent as, quote, recurring and periodic charges identified in the rental agreement. The reason why this is so important is it allows a requirement that rent be applied past due, rent be applied before other costs like lease late payments damages, legal costs or other fees.
Speaker 5: And so that makes sure that when a tenant is behind in rent and also has other costs owing like late fees, that when the tenant pays the past due rent, it gets applied to the rent that is showing to be owed and ensures that the reinstatement of tenancy is based on on that rent and not the other
Speaker 5: costs. And then finally, the bill extends the minimum notice of all rent increases in the city of Seattle to 60 days. And under current law, most rent increases can only go into effect after 30 days notice. With the exception in Seattle for rent increases greater than 10%, they previously required a 60 day notice.
Speaker 5: Under this new law, all rent increases, regardless of their size, will only be effective with a full 60 days notice. And those are the main points of the bill. We're going to have another couple of pieces of legislation that we're going to be continuing to work through, through our committee.
Speaker 5: Also coming out of the Women's Commission Housing Justice Project, Losing Home Report. But we'll talk about that another time.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Any questions or comments on the legislation? Okay. Looks like we're good. So please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 2: Thanks. John Gonzalez. Purple. Hi, Suarez. Let's get to O'Brien Pacheco. So what? President Harrell.
Speaker 1: Okay.

"<document> But what is undeniable is that the 654 miles of walls and fences already on the US-Mexico border have made a mess out of the environment there. They’ve cut off, isolated, and reduced populations of some of the rarest and most amazing animals in North America, like the jaguar and ocelot (also known as the dwarf jaguar). They’ve led to the creation of miles of roads through pristine wilderness areas. They’ve even exacerbated flooding, becoming dams when rivers have overflowed. Now, DHS is eyeing unfenced areas in two Texas wildlife refuges that conservationists consider some of the most ecologically valuable areas on the border — home to armadillos and bobcats. If a wall were to slice through these ecosystems, it could cause irreversible damage to plants and animals already under serious threat. “We’ve been dealing with all these negative environmental impacts of fences on the border for more than a decade,” says Dan Millis of the Sierra Club Borderlands project. “And Trump’s proposal would make it worse.” The border region is ecologically rich because a lot of it has been federally protected The political boundary between the US and Mexico stretches 2,000 miles from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Along the way, there are three mountain chains, the two largest deserts in North America, vast cattle ranches, a handful of cities and their sprawling suburbs, and the Southern section of the mighty Rio Grande river. Much of the region has never been heavily populated, and over the years, several large swaths of land have been designated as protected areas. Today there are 25 million acres of protected US public lands within 100 miles of the line. That includes six wildlife refuges, six national parks, tribal lands, wilderness areas, and conservation areas — all of them managed by various federal agencies and tribal governments. On the Mexican side, meanwhile, sit protected areas like El Pinacate y Gran Desierto Altar, which abuts the US Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and parts of the Organ Pipe National Monument and Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona. Map of four widlife refuges and protected areas in Arizona and New Mexico that would be impacted by a border wall These protected areas have been established, in part, to protect wildlife and plants that span both countries. In the case of the El Pinacate and Cabeza Prieta, desert species like the Sonoran pronghorn (an antelope relative) have been able to migrate back and forth.

that tried to break into his office yesterday.
I had stepped out of negotiations to go to the restroom.

Well, she was startled and shoved me over

"<document> (CNN)If you were mourning the loss of a loved one in China, at least the entertainment might have cheered you up. Until now. In rural China, hiring exotic dancers to perform at wakes is an increasingly common practice, but is now the latest focus of the country's crackdown on vice. Strippers are invited to perform at funerals, often at great expense, to attract more mourners, China's official Xinhua news agency said. Another report suggested another motivation: that the performances ""add to the fun."" Photos obtained by CNN from an attendee at a village funeral in Cheng'an County in Hebei Province show mourners of all ages, including children, watching the performance. The attendee, who asked not to be identified, said he was visiting family during the Lunar New Year holiday. While he was there, one of the elderly villagers died so he went to the funeral. ""I felt something wasn't right,"" he told CNN. ""The performance crossed the line. I had heard about hiring strippers to dance at funerals but had never seen it myself. I was shocked when I saw the strippers."" He said the villagers said this kind of performance had been practiced for a while. ""They didn't find it shocking or strange. They were used to it. ""They told me, 'what if we can't watch (this kind of) performance after it gets exposed by the media?'"" In some areas of China, the hiring of professional mourners, known as ""kusangren"" is commonplace. These can include performances, although in recent times the dance acts have increasingly tended towards the erotic. China's Ministry of Culture issued a statement Thursday announcing a crackdown on these funeral stripteases. It said that the ministry had investigated two separate incidents, one in Handan City, Hebei Province, and the other in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province. Both involved multiple-participant ""burlesque"" and ""striptease"" shows as mourners looked on. The Ministry's report said that stripteases undermined ""the cultural value of the entertainment business,"" and asserted that ""such acts were uncivilized."" The practice has been going on for some time, the report said. Exotic dancing and other forms of pornography are illegal in China. The dancers in the two cases were held in ""administrative detention"" following the two investigations, the report added. The Ministry of Culture did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Last year, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security ordered police across China to step up efforts to tackle the ""three vices"" -- prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking -- warning officials they would be held accountable for illegal activities. In February 2014, a massive crackdown on prostitution in the southern manufacturing city of Dongguan, dubbed ""Sin City"" for its huge vice industry, raided 2,000 establishments and detained more than 900 people. </document> <Summary> In rural China, hiring exotic dancers to perform at wakes is an increasingly common practice, but is now the latest focus of the country's crackdown on vice.

"<document> U.S. national security suffered in 2017. Russia is running amok, allies are losing faith in American security and prosperity commitments, and the liberal order is in crisis. Surrounding these clouds, however, a silver lining stands out: counterterrorism. U.S. counterterrorism proved successful this year, especially against jihadist movements that have plagued the United States and the world since 9/11. Jihadist terrorism still poses a problem, of course, and other forms of terrorism have risen too in intensity, but a look at the terrorism balance sheet for 2017 shows a net positive. Yet, the U.S. disengagement from the Middle East provides fertile soil for terrorist groups to grow. Long-term counterterrorism success requires a reexamination of U.S. policy in the Middle East at large. The collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate in Iraq and Syria represents the biggest counterterrorism success. The Islamic State will go underground and otherwise try to adapt, but losing their territory dealt a big blow: only three years ago, the group seemed deeply rooted in Iraq and Syria and was metastasizing in Egypt, Libya and other countries in the Muslim world. In addition to the U.S. assault on the Islamic State’s territory, the group’s virtual presence is under siege due to counterterrorism efforts, with both the quality and quantity of its propaganda suffering. Even with the collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate, so-called “homegrown violent extremists” (HVEs) will likely attack, the group will strive to restore itself in Iraq and Syria, and frustrated, would-be foreign fighters may also strike. Some of the Islamic State’s thousands of foreign fighters will also return home, posing an additional danger. Regardless, the collapse of the caliphate dealt a big blow to Islamic State. Setting aside the fall of the caliphate, the counterterrorism picture looks positive from the perspective of U.S. homeland security. In 2017, nine people died on U.S. soil from jihadist terrorist attacks (a security guard killed in Denver, two Americans and six foreign tourists, killed during the car-ramming attack in New York City). That’s nine too many but it should not obscure that the overall number is low. This low number probably stems from a mix of strong U.S. counterterrorism measures abroad, aggressive investigations and better defenses at home, and the overall weakness of jihadist networks in the United States. </document> <Summary> U.S. counterterrorism proved successful this year, especially against jihadist movements that have plagued the United States and the world since 9/11.

Even with the collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate, so-called “homegrown violent extremists” (HVEs) will likely attack, the group will strive to restore itself in Iraq and Syria, and frustrated, would-be foreign fighters may also strike.
In 2017, nine people died on U.S. soil from jihadist terrorist attacks (a security guard killed in Denver, two Americans and six foreign tourists, killed during the car-ramming attack in New York City).
This low number probably stems from a mix of strong U.S. counterterrorism measures abroad, aggressive investigations and better defenses at home, and the overall weakness of jihadist networks in the United States. </Summary>"

"<document> An eccentric man is fighting to keep his driving licence photo as a picture of him with a colander on his head because it is his 'religious right'. Ian Harris, 51, from Brighton, East Sussex, is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster whose followers, known as Pastafarians, regard the pasta strainer as a religious garment. He is challenging the DVLA over his rights to wear the metal bowl in his licence photo, which he says is equivalent to Muslim women being pictured in hijabs. Ian Harris is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, whose followers believe the colander is a religious garment and he is fighting with the DVLA for his right to wear one in his driving licence photo . The father-of-one has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear in a second bid. Mr Harris said: 'I'm fighting for the right to have my religious headgear shown on my photo. I don't understand the DVLA should be able to discriminate whether my religion is valid. 'I have a spiritual connection with the Flying Spaghetti Monster, until they have brain probes how are they going to say I don't? 'Our religion is a minority but the DVLA is discriminating because it allows people who practise major religions to wear headgear in pictures.' The musician had his appeal rejected last month but hopes to emulate fellow believer Niko Alm from Austria, who won the legal right to wear the headgear in his licence photo in 2011. Mr Alm sent off for the licence in 2008 and he was invited to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive, but after three years, his efforts finally paid off. Mr Harris began following the religion, along with his daughter Astri, 4, after it was set up in the USA in 2005 to protest the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in science classes. Members claim to believe that an invisible alien made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after 'drinking heavily.' According to its tongue-in-cheek website their 'only dogma ... is the rejection of dogma'. Rejection: Mr Harris has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear and in a second bid . A DVLA spokesman said: 'The photograph must be clear and be a current likeness to allow the Police to link the driver to driving entitlement held without confusion or ambiguity. 'Headgear is generally not acceptable, but may be permissible on religious or medical grounds and any exemptions are dealt with on a case by case basis.' Religious exemptions include the Sikh turban and the Islamic Hijab. Mr Harris, who plays banjo in The Iron Boot Scrapers, vows to fight his corner until he runs out of appeals when he will be forced to send a photo of him without the colander. He said: 'When I get to the final appeal I will have to send a photo without a colander but that would be a bad day for religious freedom.' Other countries including the United States, Austria and the Czech Republic allow Pastafarians to wear the metal sieves in their licence pictures. The Austrian authorities allowed Niko Alm to wear the unusual headgear as it is deemed a suitable accessory for his 'Pastafarian' religion . Shawna Hammon from Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear . In September last year Shawna Hammond from Oklahoma, U.S. was granted permission to wear one in her licence photograph. She said  the photo obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. Earlier that year, Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. In 2013, a Czech man was allowed to wear the headgear on his official identity card after officials ruled that turning down his request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'. </document> <Summary> Ian Harris, 51, from Brighton, East Sussex, is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster whose followers, known as Pastafarians, regard the pasta strainer as a religious garment.

"<document> Ralph Vaughan Williams's Lark Ascending is the nation's favourite piece of classic music . The Lark Ascending has been voted the nation's favourite piece of classical music. Ralph Vaughan Williams's work topped the Classic FM Hall of Fame after listeners cast more than 200,000 votes. It topped the poll last year as well and four years ago was named the nation's favourite Desert Island Discs tune. British composer Vaughan Williams was inspired by a poem of the same name by George Meredith. He completed the more familiar orchestral version in 1920. It found a wide audience last year when it was played as Hayley, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, took a lethal cocktail to end her suffering on Coronation Street, following a battle with cancer. The top five was completed by Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2, another Vaughan Williams work Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, Elgar's Enigma Variations and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5. The full poll - 300 pieces of music in total - also includes 12 pieces of music used to soundtrack video games, with two of them making the top 20. Music from the Final Fantasy series, by Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu, is at number nine while The Elder Scrolls, composed by Bafta award-winner Jeremy Soule, is at number 11. John Suchet, who presents a weekday show on the station, said: 'Twenty years after the very first Classic FM Hall of Fame countdown, I'm delighted that we've attracted so many votes for our chart. 'What I find truly exciting is the continued increase in a younger audience for classical music - I didn't expect to be thanking the video game industry for introducing the genre to a new generation of people, but it's wonderful.'

The businessman is now refusing to pay the fine that was issued in a Torbay council car park. Scroll down for video . 'Diabolical': Phil Haste (left) said he could not understand why he was issued with a penalty notice, as he clearly had a valid parking permit in his car and no longer required his tax disc to be shown . Mr Haste sent his appeal to the council on Saturday after being issued with the ticket last month and said it was a 'diabolical' decision to fine him. The government abolished paper tax discs on October 1 last year, meaning they no longer need to be shown on a vehicle windscreen. Mr Haste, who lives in Torquay, said: 'I would rather go to court than pay the fine. Issuing tickets of this ilk show they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 'It's diabolical. The council employ these people to do a job for them and it's clearly not being presented clearly. 'They are obviously trying to just grab money where they can. I don't understand why I got this fine.'

'I have a car parking permit which was clearly on display on the dashboard of my car, so I just can't understand it.' Torbay Council said it was not their policy to issue fines for road tax offences and urged Mr Haste to appeal.

When this contract comes up again next year to rebid, might the administration consider putting it out to bid by quadrants of the city so that we can have towers who can respond more quickly in southwest Denver?
We're still working on trying to break out our data by districts.
15,000 tows last year, but 12,000 of those were impound tows.
I would like to get some information about the overall break-even point of this program.

"<document> Today, President Donald Trump will reportedly issue an executive order to begin construction of a wall along the U.S-Mexico border. The long-awaited move follows through on one of Trump’s most visible campaign promises.¶ It’s also a big mistake. Not only would a wall be outrageously expensive — estimates range as high as $14 billion (and no, Mexico won’t pay for it) — but a wall is misguided because it addresses the exact wrong problem. The biggest immigration crisis facing the country has nothing to do with Mexicans illegally crossing the border. Instead, it’s that hundreds of thousands of Central Americans are fleeing brutal violence and extreme poverty in their home countries and seeking asylum in the United States — but our immigration system is overwhelmed and completely unprepared to handle the flood.¶ I know this issue firsthand. Over the past two decades, I have served in senior homeland security positions in both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations — first as policy director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the years after the 9/11 attacks, and most recently as assistant secretary of homeland security for border, immigration and trade policy in the Obama administration. During those years, I have seen an extraordinary transformation not only of our border, but also in our deepening relationship with Mexico.¶ It’s true that in the 1990s, the border was out of control, with illegal entries approaching 2 million a year. But since then, we’ve dramatically strengthened enforcement by tripling the size of the Border Patrol, deploying drones and, yes, constructing hundreds of miles of fence along the border. It’s now hard to cross, and the economics of human smuggling show this: It now costs 12 times more in real dollars to hire a “coyote” than 15 years ago. That’s dramatic bipartisan progress in securing our border, although you wouldn’t have known it from last year’s presidential campaign.¶ More importantly, Mexico has changed. Over the past two decades, it has grown into the world’s 11th largest economy, deeply integrated with ours through cross-border infrastructure and supply chains, all facilitated by binational efforts to reduce barriers to commerce at the border. As a result, there are good jobs for Mexicans in Mexico — and, thus, more reasons for Mexicans to stay. This was certainly true during our economic crisis of 2008-09, but it remains true today.¶ In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, more Mexicans now leave the U.S. than head north, and border apprehensions are down a whopping 75 percent since 2000. Simply put, fewer people are coming, and our border authorities catch and remove most who try.¶ This is not to say there isn’t a crisis, however. There is one, but it’s different from the one Trump thinks exists. It doesn’t involve Mexican migrants, and a wall won’t solve it. The actual crisis involves thousands of migrants from Central America’s “Northern Triangle” — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — who are fleeing brutal gang violence, extreme poverty or malnutrition. Roughly half of these migrants are women and young children escaping desperate circumstances, facing the real possibility of death or rape if they stay. Others are fleeing extreme poverty in remote regions where education ends at the sixth grade and families are limited to one meal a day.¶ America obviously cannot solve all the economic problems of Central America, but under U.S. and international law, all migrants are afforded the opportunity to apply for asylum protection if they make it to U.S. soil. If U.S. immigration officials make an initial determination that the migrants have a “credible fear” of harm back home, they are referred to U.S. immigration courts for a full hearing on their asylum claim. Unaccompanied children who reach the U.S. are quickly either placed in foster care or with U.S.-based relatives while their asylum claims are heard in court. Given the dangerous conditions in Central America, nearly half of these asylum claims ultimately succeed. </document> <Summary> Today, President Donald Trump will reportedly issue an executive order to begin construction of a wall along the U.S-Mexico border.

"<document> Of course, humans seize every opportunity to claim special moral qualities, placing themselves above brutal nature and the “beasts that populate it. Yet while it is no great intellectual triumph for humans to establish their primacy over nature—they have done so for millennia—the real question turns on the exact character that primacy assumes as it is historically played out. In the present context, “dominion” (as spelled out in Genesis and other texts) has meant exploitation and abuse, that is, domination largely bereft if positive ethical content – although some recent works (for example Matthew Scully’s Dominion) have sought to ground a defense of animal rights in religion. A different kind of human obligation would point in the direction of stewardship, calling attention to equity, balance, ecological sustainability, and coexistence between humans and the natural world. So far, however, human beings have done little to distance themselves from a brutal or Hobbesian state of nature having repeatedly proven themselves the most destructive and murderous of all creatures. The view of natural relations adopted here derives from Regan’s philosophical work – namely that all sentient being has inalienable rights to be free of pain and suffering at the hands of humans. For Regan, this line of thinking holds to several interrelated premises: (1) no moral justification exists for overriding animal interests in order to serve “higher interests”; (2) what matters is not specific intellectual or communication skills but rather the capacity to experience pain, suffering and loss; (3) while much of nature is inescapably used by humans as resources to satisfy material and other needs, this logic should not extend to other sentient beings; (4) humans ought to be stewards of nature and other species within it to the extent possible; and (5) human and animal interests are closely bound together within the same social and historical processes. </document> <Summary> Humans seize every opportunity to claim special moral qualities, placing themselves above brutal nature and the “beasts that populate it.

"<document> Forget the allegations of a costly encounter between the Secret Service and Colombian hookers. It was US diplomacy that paid the steepest price at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena. While much of the media coverage narrowed in on allegations that a dozen of the president's men had to be sent home for carousing with prostitutes prior to the arrival of US President Barack Obama, the real action took place once he got there. Obama got an across-the-spectrum earful for the United States' insistence that Cuba can't attend the hemispheric meetings until it makes major democratic reforms. The meetings ended with a thud Sunday, lacking a final declaration or statement of consensus, because so many regional leaders said they won't go to the next Americas summit — in Panama in 2015 — unless Cuba can be there too. That the usual ""yanqui"" bashers like Bolivia's Evo Morales would criticize Washington's Cuba policy was hardly a surprise. Far more significant was the degree to which key American allies, like Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Colombian leader Juan Manuel Santos, the summit's host, were willing to go to bat for Havana. Never mind that Latin America has gone through a period of blistering economic growth in recent years, thanks in large part to Washington-backed trade policies. Or that US commerce with the region has surged 46 percent since 2009, as Obama told fellow leaders. It was the US trade embargo against Cuba — not trade — that they wanted to talk about. From left to right, Latin leaders backed Cuba with a unanimity that was unimaginable during the Cold War, or even as recently as a few years ago, when the US could count on conservative governments in the region to support its Cuba policies. This time, only Canada's Stephen Harper sided with Washington in opposing Havana's presence at the gatherings, hosted by the Organization of American States (OAS), which kicked out Cuba in 1961. Obama sought to deflect the criticism by suggesting that Cuba and the octogenarian Castros were old news and not pertinent to the region's real problems. “Sometimes those controversies date back to before I was born,"" said the US president, born two years after Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution swept the island. But with the American trade embargo against the island still very much alive after 50 years, Latin leaders are tired of having to choose sides between Washington and Havana and hear their constituents complain of American bullying. “Isolation, embargo, indifference and looking the other way have shown their inefficiency,"" Santos said Saturday in his remarks to open the summit, to hearty applause. “It is an anachronism that keeps us anchored in a Cold War era.” Santos, a moderate who nevertheless traveled to Havana last month to meet with Cuban President Raul Castro about the island's exclusion from the summit, said future gatherings without Cuba would be “unacceptable.” </document> <Summary> Obama got an across-the-spectrum earful for the United States' insistence that Cuba can't attend the hemispheric meetings until it makes major democratic reforms.

"<document> With the Chinese dragon economy losing some of its fire as it slows at a faster-than-expected rate, some manufacturers are getting burned with labour disputes, unexpected shutdowns and massive layoffs as the declining manufacturing sector seriously disrupts their supply chains. North American enterprises consider reshoring in the wake of turmoil in the Chinese economy. The introduction of annual minimum wage increases – upping salaries 50% since 2011 – and the broad impact of rising Chinese labour rates is being felt in many industries, particularly electronics. Renewed emphasis on the enforcement of manufacturing regulations is also factoring into a climate that is less ‘business friendly’ than it once was, with the end result being an increasing number of manufacturers pulling up stakes and moving to other rapidly developing economies within Asia – or even reinvesting in North America. Nokia recently laid off 9,000 employees and shuttered factories in Beijing, Dongguan and Suzhou – where it has operated since 1998 – citing the need to maintain cost controls, and refocus on research and development. Some of its manufacturing is transferring to Vietnam. Foxconn – one of China’s largest exporters and manufacturer of iconic brands such as Apple’s iPhone – has announced a $5 billion investment in India to build 12 factories. Foxconn’s Chinese operations have been chronically plagued with labour shortages and unrest. Samsung is accelerating its pace of withdrawal from China, and shifting production facilities to Vietnam, with a new $2 billion plant opening in 2015, the construction of another $3 billion plant announced, and $12 billion in investments pledged Samsung cites lower wages and favourable tax incentives as prime motivators for the move. One of today’s greatest secrets is the fact that it’s just as cheap – if not cheaper – to manufacturer goods in North America, without the drama and turmoil. North American manufacturing offers a reliable, skilled workforce, highly regulated to the benefit of everyone involved, with a history of ethical treatment of employees, and competitive pricing when factoring in the total cost of production, sans customs, tariffs, duties, shipping time, and communication barriers. It’s something Panasonic clearly realized: Panasonic recently closed its Beijing-based lithium-ion battery factory – which had operated since 2000 – cutting 1,300 jobs, and citing the need to refocus on higher-margin products such as electric car batteries. Panasonic has committed to a multi-billion dollar investment in Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. The time is overdue for manufacturers to reassess the sometimes decades old ‘wisdom’ that North America can’t compete with China. The Chinese advantage is shrinking fast, and the default option that China is always cheaper should be treated with scepticism. </document> <Summary> With the Chinese dragon economy losing some of its fire as it slows at a faster-than-expected rate, some manufacturers are getting burned with labour disputes, unexpected shutdowns and massive layoffs as the declining manufacturing sector seriously disrupts their supply chains.

 </document> <Summary> The Belmont Shore Parking and Business Improvement Area, also known as a business improvement district, was established by the City Council in 1983, allowing for the levy of an annual assessment to be paid by businesses located in the district.
The city contracts with the Belmont Shore Business Association to manage the Business Improvement District.
The annual report proposes no change to the district boundaries or the method of levying the assessment.
The proposed activities will focus on marketing, business assistance, and special events.
The City Council approved a resolution granting approval of the annual report, declaring the intention of the City Council to levy the assessment and set the date of the public hearing.
The City Council shall hear and consider all protests from area businesses against the assessment. </Summary>"
"<document> First of all, in the midst of weakening family and community structures, adolescents tend to perceive that joining a fighting force may offer them better opportunities to fulfill their social and psychological needs-such as the need to be seen as worthy and capable individuals with access to resources and power. For males, engagement with fighting forces tend to provide opportunities to attain the ‘masculine’ status that is much prized amongst peers. For others, social and economic stagnation and the loss of education opportunities lure them to military recruitment. In such a situation, peer pressure usually plays a significant role in stimulating the desire to enlist. Adolescents who are separated from their families have moved out of their communities tend to succumb to peer pressure more easily. For their part, those who recruit adolescents often do so by promising them social power and economic opportunities that are lacking in their communities. </document> <Summary> First of all, in the midst of weakening family and community structures, adolescents tend to perceive that joining a fighting force may offer them better opportunities to fulfill their social and psychological needs-such as the need to be seen as worthy and capable individuals with access to resources and power.

"<document> (CNN)At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency. More than 60 people were rescued Thursday from the chilly waters in Russia's Far East. The Dalniy Vostok freezer trawler -- a commercial fishing vessel -- was carrying 132 people, the ministry said. Of the people on board, 78 were Russians. The 54 others were foreign nationals from Myanmar, Ukraine, Lithuania and Vanuatu, according to the news agency, with the majority coming from Myanmar. More than 20 fishing vessels are searching for the 15 people still thought to be missing, Tass said. The shipwreck was swift, with the trawler going down in the Sea of Okhotsk within 15 minutes of getting into difficulties, the news agency reported. The most likely cause of the shipwreck was collision with an obstacle which damaged the hull, the official spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, is quoted as saying. The trawler is also thought to have keeled over as a result of hauling some 80 tons of fish on to the deck, the chairman of the emergencies commission in the Kamchatka region, Sergey Khabarov, told Tass. </document> <Summary> (CNN)At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency.

"<document> Speaker 2: Perfect. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, President Park.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Gilmore. All right. That concludes the questions on this one. Madam Secretary, if you please, put the next item on our screens. And Councilmember CdeBaca, if you want to go ahead with your questions on 44.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President. Is there anybody here to answer questions on this contract? Can you introduce yourself?
Speaker 3: Good evening. I'm John Looper with Department of Housing Stability.
Speaker 5: Awesome. Thank you so much for coming up tonight. Very excited about these dollars for motel vouchers have had some challenges when recommending this option to constituents because we're not really sure who to direct them to and how to know when we've spent down our vouchers.
Speaker 5: And so I'm wondering if in the coming year if there's any new infrastructure electronically that's being built to track our our vouchers in real time? Or how do we as city council representatives know what's left in our voucher bank when we're trying to connect constituents to these emergency services?
Speaker 3: So for as far as like an electronic way of tracking or a voucher bank, we don't really have that set up yet. That's something we could look into in the future. This specific contract is really for the family motel, which is for 30 rooms.
Speaker 3: That's that's kind of it's. It's managed between the Volunteers of America, our office, Department of Housing, Stability, and then Department of Human Services. So Human Services has different outreach workers that write the vouchers to this program. And then Volunteers of America also has a an evening voucher rider that.
Speaker 3: All right. Vouchers to this program also and they work out of Samaritan House every evening.
Speaker 5: So how do we know what our usage is throughout the year?
Speaker 3: So for this this specific contract, it's pretty much 100% use. I think the the occupancy is in the high nineties and they serve about just over a thousand families within a year. There are a couple of other contracted motels and that's kind of as an add need basis as the this family motel fills and they have to
Speaker 3: overflow into other motels that are contract motels.
Speaker 5: So when you say 100% utilized, what does that mean? Does that mean that they're 100% full right now and we have a waiting list or what is that?
Speaker 3: They're in the high nineties for their utilization. So at some nights they're at 100%. And we're we're sending families to contracted motels. The other motels other nights they might be 90% full. And so it just kind of varies night to night.
Speaker 3: Average stay is about ten days. So families there, though, some of them may stay for just a night. Some of them may stay for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the needs of that family.
Speaker 5: And so is there with this specific one, are there preconditions of.
Speaker 2: Service.
Speaker 1: Or.
Speaker 5: How do you how do you qualify to get into.
Speaker 1: This?
Speaker 3: So really, if if a family is homeless in Denver, there could be. A man or woman. As long as they have children and they're homeless in Denver, they just need to connect with the Department of Human Services with their general assistance program Monday through Friday through from, I believe it's eight four.
Speaker 3: And then if they aren't at Denver, Human Services between that timeframe, they would utilize Samaritan House with the voucher riders that are there in the evenings and they'll they'll ask questions. Usually if people are residents of Denver or they're homeless in Denver, they can get multiple nights and then they can meet with a staff member to look
Speaker 3: at some kind of future planning for them if they're from out of state. They're usually always given one night. And then there we figure out what the next steps would be for that family.
Speaker 5: So before we send somebody to the Samaritan House.
Speaker 2: Or Denver Human Services.
Speaker 5: How do we know if we're at the 90% or 100%? Because it's hard to send someone who has very little resources to a Denver Human Services spot during the day knowing that that night there are not going to be any vouchers.
Speaker 5: Who do we contact?
Speaker 3: So that would be during the day. It'd be it would be human services, general assistance. And I don't have that number handy, but just through Human Services, the General Assistance Department, they'll be able to answer that question. It's hard to contact Volunteers of America in the evening to find that out because they're they're seeing people as they're
Speaker 3: coming in. We don't. I think what you're getting at is we don't really have like a like a system that's showing the actual users. They keep track of that on hand as people are coming in. So that's something that could be improved.
Speaker 5: Is there a plan for that?
Speaker 3: I'm not sure. So there's a are the Department of Housing Stability, they're going through a strategic planning process. And part of that's going to be the shelter strategy planning. And so that may be part of that.
Speaker 5: Some it's as simple as Google forms. If the providers could all get on the same page, it would be really helpful for the rest of us trying to be that broker for services. So thank you.
Speaker 3: Okay. You're welcome.

"<document> Speaker 0: The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with our agenda. So first matter on our agenda, item number one, finance and housing. The report on the Finance and Housing Committee. Please read the report.
Speaker 0: Agenda item one Resolution 31931. A resolution establishing a watch list of large, complex, discrete capital projects that will require enhanced quarterly monitoring reports for the 2020 calendar year. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended. Casper Mosquito.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. This resolution adopts the 2020 watch list of projects from the Cities Capital Improvement Program, for which the executive will provide quarterly reports. This is a list of 17 large, discrete, complex projects that will be subject to in-depth quarterly reporting this year.
Speaker 3: This watchlist was established, as you all know, I think, in by ordinance in 2018 after several projects had significant overruns and delays. Without the council or the public's knowledge involvement, including the $70 million overrun at the Seattle seawall and streetcar.
Speaker 3: So this watch list is a result of the hard work of my colleagues, Councilmember Herbold and former colleague Councilmember Johnson. Thank you for all of your work on this. And I'm excited that we were able to have an in-depth conversation in our committee.
Speaker 3: Add to the watch list. This watch list now contains projects that would like that. We would like to have additional oversight and transparency on making sure that there's clear scope and that we watch for shifting estimates in cost or uncertain capital funding plans.
Speaker 3: If there's ill defined operation costs, plans or other funding plans, we will be able to have clear, I think, heads up on that and be able to have the legislative branch weigh in on our perceived priorities, identify significant, significant questions and ask questions about scope, schedule and budget so that we can ensure that the public's dollars is
Speaker 3: being well accounted for and that we are on track to fulfilling the Council's desired outcomes for these projects. Happy to bring forward this resolution today and thank our colleagues from the Finance and Housing Committee for their work to make this resolution even better.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any more comments? Casper Hubbell. I just want to flag that. One of the things that we talked about in committee was a recognition that the intent of the resolution was for the Finance Committee to be the designated committee to hear the reports overall.
Speaker 0: But there is a hope that individual committees that have responsibility for capital improvement projects that are on the watch list, that those individual committee communities do a deeper dove on monitoring projects that are in the watch list and consider spending limitations where appropriate, as yet another way to enhance oversight, perhaps by using stage gating or budget provisos
Speaker 0: to have additional oversight on some of those projects. And thanks to Chair Mascara, I appreciate that. She has indicated that she also has interest in figuring out a way whether or not we can, as a council, identify some ways, some checks and balances on ourselves to make sure that that enhanced oversight is happening.
Speaker 0: We can't we can't rely totally on the Budget Office and we can't totally rely on our central staff. I think we have to also think creatively about ways that we can do our part in monitoring.
Speaker 5: Some of these projects.
Speaker 0: Thank you for your comments, Councilor Muscat, you want to make a motion?
Speaker 3: Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that the full council approve resolution 31931 as amended in the Finance and Housing Committee.
Speaker 0: Second motion and a second. With that, let's go to a vote. All those in favor say I. I don't suppose they know the ayes have it. Thank you. The resolution passes. Thank you. Let's go to item number two on the report of the Transportation Utilities Committee.

"<document> Speaker 2: The Report of the Human Services and Public Health Committee. Agenda Item two Resolution 317 39 expressing the city's close commitment to being a more age friendly city under the criteria established by the World Health Organization and the AARP, Network of Age Friendly Communities Committee recommends that the full council adopt the resolution as amended.
Speaker 4: Good. Thank you very much for reading that into the record. I want to say thank you to my colleagues for supporting this and supporting me in this work. The age friendly designation for the city of Seattle happened at the end of August, just of 2016, and our mayor had worked with AARP and the World Health Organization so
Speaker 4: Seattle could be designated an age friendly city. Between that point and now, I will say that not as much has been accomplished as I would like to see. But fortunately, we now have an action plan and this resolution has been drafted.
Speaker 4: And the mayor just last week announced within the departments what the various departments are going to do. But I do want to acknowledge and say special thanks to Steve Lee from the mayor's office and Catherine Lester from the Human Services Department and our own Lily Ramon, who is now, as of last Saturday, Lily Rau, for the good
Speaker 4: work that they have done on that to generate these really age friendly goals and success measures. What I'm focused on is department by department, but I'd like to start with Seattle Department of Transportation. I would like to see us really implement an institute across our city, a new sidewalk program, and I should say sidewalk programs, plural.
Speaker 4: We can learn from other cities, but small things such as maintaining our sidewalks across the city, making a network that connects, having longer walk signals for safe crossing where appropriate, not just for seniors, people with strollers, kids who are learning to ride a scooter, which I mentioned earlier before, or people with disabilities.
Speaker 4: We really need to be conscious across our city that all of us are going to get there one time or another, so we might as well get going on it right away. So there are eight domains in the World Health Organization's criteria for livability, and it includes affordable housing, better transportation, better connections for neighbors with people who
Speaker 4: are aging and encouraging different ways for people to live. And that includes our auxiliary dwelling or accessory dwelling units. There are many, many things we can do, but as we're thinking about how do we make this a city where we are using a race and social justice lens?
Speaker 4: I really want us to include the lens for people who are aging. I think we can do a great thing, a great number of things with a small number of small costs, but make it a dramatic difference for our city.
Speaker 4: So I know that all of you have heard me say age friendly probably a thousand times in the last four months. But I say thank you, thank you for supporting this resolution. There's a lot we can do and I look forward to doing it with you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Customer Show.
Speaker 1: Now.
Speaker 0: I was led to believe there could be an amendment she would be proposing by substituting versions three for two. Is that so?
Speaker 4: Thank you very much. These were provisions that Councilmember Harold Harrell I'm sorry, Councilmember Herbold recommended. And they really do focus on unemployed workers. That provides additional occupational training for people who are over 65 and also recognizing that people who are over 65 are either staying in or sometimes rejoining the labor force for whatever reasons that are in
Speaker 4: their individual lives. So I support Councilmember. Her Bolts recommendations, and they're in two warehouses on page three of the resolution that's in front of us.
Speaker 0: So you moved to substitute version three for version two? Is there a second? All those in favor of substituting version three for version two a please say I. I oppose the ayes have it. So we have a amended resolution.
Speaker 0: Are you. Would you like to see any more words? Better?
Speaker 4: You know, I think we're I think we're good. I said what I had to say, but I did want to recognize that Alan Lee on central staff has also been very helpful and moving things quickly and responding to the number of amendments that have been coming in.
Speaker 4: So this started off about two months ago, and I think that we've made some real progress on it. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any further comments? All those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended? Vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries and the minute resolution is adopted, the chair will sign it. All right.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Please read the next agenda items. Plural, I guess. Three through five into the record agenda items.

"<document> Transboundary river treaties and international conflict While this study is motivated by the premise that water scarcity can contribute to militarized international conflict, we echo some of the skepticism regarding the ‘water wars’ scenario. As Salehyan (2008) observes, proponents of the deterministic view that environmental scarcity leads to armed conflict tend to overlook the role of human agency and the moderating effects of institutions. International institutions, in particular, are one important factor that helps explain why international conflicts over water are comparatively rare. Rather than simply being the opposite of conflict, formal international cooperation is one method for managing transboundary water sources and thereby preventing the emergence and escalation of international water disputes. We thus view international institutions as critical explanatory variables that have been largely overlooked in many discussions of international water conflict. 5 International treaties have become an increasingly common means of managing transboundary rivers. International organizations, such as the United Nations and World Bank, often advocate the formation of river treaties. In the case of tensions in the Aral Sea basin, for example, the UN Secretary General has recommended a formal international accord to better manage the rivers feeding the Aral Sea (Heintz, 2010). This trend has been reflected in recent academic research investigating the conditions leading to river treaty formation (e.g. Tir & Ackerman, 2009; Stinnett & Tir, 2009; Tir & Stinnett, 2011). River treaties can specify how the river will be shared, set water quality targets, determine acceptable water withdrawal rates, or balance navigation, water level, and water quality needs; this will, in turn, help minimize the stresses placed on the river and make use more effective in the long run. By helping to resolve the underlying problems that occur because of the competing use of rivers – and which are likely to be exacerbated by increased water scarcity – treaties can alleviate political tensions and reduce international conflict (Wolf, Yoffe & Giordano, 2003). </document> <Summary> While this study is motivated by the premise that water scarcity can contribute to militarized international conflict, we echo some of the skepticism regarding the ‘water wars’ scenario.

"<document> Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘tough year’. The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a £446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside £856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra £334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a £446million loss in the first three months of the year . In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 . Chief executive Ross McEwan said: ‘This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.’ The latest news wiped more than £700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin – nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting – was even knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. ‘It’s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.’ </document> <Summary> Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘tough year’.

"<document> A baby girl was given hypothermia in order to keep her alive after she developed a potentially fatal brain condition. Caitlin Kellie-Jones suffered from Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood. To control the condition Caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. Nicola Kellie-Jones and partner Paul with children Caitlin and Dylan are raising money to help other children . Medics gave little Caitlin, pictured, hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage . Caitlin, pictured, was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy minutes after she was born . It allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, Caitlin, now ten months old, recovered from HIE and is able to feed and play. Her parents, Nicola and Paul, are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out. Ms Kellie-Jones,  27, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: 'Caitlin was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses. 'She wasn't moving or breathing for herself, and was making no noise. 'I had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away. Doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour. 'It was such a relief to bring her home.' Caitlin was born on May 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy. She was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine. Despite her ordeal, Caitlin, who is now 10 months old, seems to be developing normally . Ms Kellie-Jones, right, wants to raise £16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies . Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'My mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and I often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies, but I never imagined it would be me. Ms Kellie-Jones said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally . 'We couldn't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures. I knew what they were all trying to tell me, everyone thought she wouldn't make it. 'I didn't move from her side for hours. I had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so I could prepare myself, but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it. 'Paul was the opposite, he wanted to know the best possible outcome. 'We were lucky that we were able to get Caitlin on one of the machines, otherwise we might not have been bringing her home.' Caitlin was born and treated at Royal Preston Hospital, where there are only two cooling machines available. Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'We are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day. 'I'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital, which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage, and, if I raise enough, another cooling machine for the neonatal unit. 'My target is to raise at least £16,000. 'Her brother Dylan, 10, is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too. 'At his age he could have thought what happened to Caitlin was normal, but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces.' Caitlin will need follow up appointments until she is two, but it is hoped she will make a full recovery. To donate go to: www.justgiving.com/CaitlinsCoolingCause .

"<document> A lot of people have been noting that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change will leave the US as one of just three non-participating countries in the world. We are nearly alone on this. Isolated. But I don't think this talking point means quite what people think it does. It was possible to get nearly every country in the world to join the agreement because the agreement does not really do anything. The agreement allows countries to set their own targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and it prescribes no way to enforce those targets. Since the agreement is fundamentally symbolic — an expression of global intent to combat climate change — Trump's choice to withdraw is similarly a symbol of his intent for the US to unencumber itself from international commitments. Compared to other international agreements that Trump complains about, Paris was easy to withdraw from. Doing so will not enrage key Republican political constituencies and will not produce much in the way of policy effects. As I wrote yesterday, the agreement may even be marginally more effective without us involved. Because of the agreement's non-binding nature, and because so many of the factors slowing the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions are outside the purview of Trump and Congress, our withdrawal probably will not even have a material effect on emissions or global temperatures. And that's why Trump left this agreement, rather than, say, NAFTA or NATO — binding agreements where withdrawal would impose tangible costs. For all of Trump's ""America first"" talk, and for all the radical ideas he has expressed about international relations, he is doing surprisingly little to change America's place in the international order. Withdrawing from Paris is performative isolationism; so far, Trump has chickened out of pursuing real isolationism. He considered starting the process to withdraw from NAFTA, but was talked out of it by his advisers. He instead pledged to renegotiate the agreement to get better deals at the margin — for example, on the sale of American dairy products to Canada — an issue that was also on President Obama's agenda, and that would have been addressed in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He rattled his saber at China, declaring his intention to beat them on trade and flirting with recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. But President Xi Jinping got Trump to back down on Taiwan by giving him the silent treatment. Then, Trump declared victory on Chinese trade after reaching a tiny, beef-for-chicken trade deal in which China got the better end of the stick. Trump claimed he didn't need to be too harsh on China because the Chinese had acquiesced to his demand that they stop artificially weakening their currency — a step the Chinese had actually taken years before he took office. If there is going to be a protectionist reimagining of America's trade policy under Trump, it is not yet in evidence. The steps he has taken so far — for example, imposing tariffs on softwood lumber — are within the realm of normal actions undertaken by past presidents who were broadly committed to free trade, like President George W. Bush. The president has done his part to weaken the NATO alliance with his words, or lack thereof, but so far we remain officially committed to the alliance. The president's advisers insist he is committed to NATO's Article V mutual-defense agreement, even if the president has been reluctant to say as much out loud. If Trump came into office intending to lift sanctions and reach détente with Russia, the widening scandal around his campaign — and the replacement of his pro-Russian national-security adviser Michael Flynn with a normal human being — seem to have discouraged him from doing so. It does look like the Russians may get their tennis club on the eastern shore of Maryland back; I doubt that was Vladimir Putin's top concern. Trump hasn't been able to retrench and realign the US in the ways he claims he wants to because the consequences would be too negative. Pulling out of NAFTA would shrink the US economy and cause the stock market to fall. Trump wants NATO for its help on anti-terror initiatives. Easing up too much on Russia right now would seem too fishy. By contrast, withdrawing from the Paris agreement is little more than a middle finger to the rest of the world. An obscene gesture, but a gesture nonetheless. The most tangible problem created by our withdrawal from the accord may be a decline in America's global standing and leadership. But I tend to think that decline is largely a function of Trump's presidency itself; America would hardly be seen as a leader on climate change under Trump if we had instead stayed in the accord and ignored our emissions targets. To the extent our withdrawal alienates the world from us, that aligns with Trump's intent in withdrawing, and does indeed make the US more isolated. But Trump has been reluctant to take more concrete and irrevocable isolating steps, for clear reasons. </document> <Summary> A lot of people have been noting that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change will leave the US as one of just three non-participating countries in the world.

"<document> How does FMF work? Most FMF-funded purchases are made through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) framework. A few countries have received exceptions to use FMF funds for Direct Commercial Sales. Foreign Military Financing funds are budgeted three years in advance, as part of the regular State Department budget cycle. For FY2011, the total funding for the FMF program was $5.37 billion. The FY2012 estimate was $6.31 billion. (Source – pdf file; see p. 171) How does an FMF-financed sale work? For the most part, an FMF-financed sale works just like other sales under the Foreign Military Sales process. The main difference is that funding comes from the FMF program rather than the foreign government customer. (A sale may be fully funded through FMF, or may be partially FMF-funded and partially paid by the foreign customer.) This has the benefit of helping allied countries buy military equipment they otherwise might not be able to afford, creating additional sales opportunities for U.S. defense companies. For U.S. defense companies, ensuring that Foreign Military Financing funds are available and budgeted to a particular sale will probably require additional coordination during the pre-LOR stage of the FMS process. We’ll discuss the pre-LOR process in more detail in a separate post. FMF vs. FMS Clients often ask me about the difference between Foreign Military Financing and Foreign Military Sales. In reality, FMF and FMS aren’t directly comparable. FMF provides funding for defense purchases, while FMS is the program for managing the sale and transfer of military items. Sales funded by FMF are almost always processed through the FMS program. (Only a few countries have exceptions to use FMF funds for Direct Commercial Sales.) The FMS program, on the other hand, may be used for FMF-financed sales, or for sales paid for by the foreign customer. </document> <Summary> Most FMF-funded purchases are made through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) framework.

"<document> BEIJING--With progress slow toward a broad investment treaty with the U.S., senior Chinese officials are focusing on one area they hope could show a willingness to open China's markets: green finance. Liu He, top economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, is spearheading an effort to encourage U.S. companies to invest in energy-efficient projects in China, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Liu discussed the initiative during his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday, these people say, a day before the start of the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the world's two largest economies. The emphasis on a relatively low-profile sector comes as negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty that would give U.S. and Chinese companies better access to each other's markets crawl into their ninth year. Beijing's latest offer, delivered last year, still listed as many as 40 sectors that would be off limits to foreign investors. The U.S. has said that this ""negative list"" needs to be significantly whittled down. Mr. Lew indicated in Beijing that while talks go on over a broader treaty, access can be improved sector-by-sector. The green-finance initiative led by Mr. Liu includes a fund that would pool U.S. and Chinese capital to invest in environmentally friendly projects in China. Mr. Liu is director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, which acts somewhat like the White House's National Economic Council. The first round of investment in the fund is expected to be around 20 billion yuan ($3 billion). Chinese officials hope the fact that many of the planned projects will be government-supported will make the fund attractive to U.S. investors. Provinces including Zhejiang and Jiangsu in eastern China and Hebei in the north have signed on to offer projects to invest in, according to the officials. As for the broader treaty, Mr. Lew hopes the Obama administration can carry talks ""close to the finishing line"" in its remaining months in office, he said in a speech Sunday at Beijing's Tsinghua University. But in a recent report, David Dollar, a senior fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former Treasury attaché in Beijing, wrote that ""Chinese leaders will want to wait and see what administration they will be dealing with and to save deliverables for those future negotiations."" China's commerce ministry has been leading the effort on the negative list. But the process also involves many other ministries--in areas from security to education and culture--that have resisted opening up, Chinese officials say. The green-finance initiative comes as Beijing puts increasing emphasis on dealing with the country's enormous environmental issues . Rapid growth in recent decades, most powered by real estate, construction and smokestack industries, has resulted in not only rising debt but also polluted skies over much of the country. China faces a huge need for capital to clean up its environment, officials and analysts say. The People's Bank of China, which last year started making it easier for companies to sell bonds pay for energy-efficient projects, estimates environmental projects will require at least $320 billion a year over the next five years--and experts say the government's fiscal resources can cover no more than 15% of that. On Monday, Mr. Lew said a new global climate accord reached by the U.S., China and other countries will require ""the unprecedented levels of funding."" ""A variety of channels"" including new funds and direct bilateral assistance will be needed to meet those needs, he said. </document> <Summary> green finance.

"<document> Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (pictured) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a nine-year-old . Calais schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a range of crimes which are likely to see him jailed for life, prosecutors said today. The 38-year-old appeared before a judge on Friday night and was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering the nine-year-old identified solely by her first name of Chloe. Despite being banned from France for earlier offences, Zbigniew was on his way to England on Wednesday from Calais when he struck. A statement released by Boulogne prosecutors said: 'The investigating judge conducted his indictment for the following reasons: rape of a minor, kidnapping and murder. 'During his interrogation, the person in custody had admitted his involvement in the alleged crimes, but failed to state the reasons for his action.' Confirming that Huminski had been 'placed in custody in a regional prison', his lawyer Antoine Deguines said: 'He did not speak to the judge, as his right. 'I have not been able to speak much with him, he does not talk much and, it seems, is in shock over what happened. It's hard for him to address the facts'. Asked if Zbigniew had offered any remorse, Mr Deguines said: 'No, he is saying very little about anything.' It came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Calais on Saturday to take part in a second 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe, whose funeral will take place in the port city's St Peter's Church on Wednesday. Mr Deguines confirmed Huminski had been on his way to see his sister in Southampton when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais, and then attacked Chloe while drunk. Huminski was supposed to be in prison in Poland - but he exploited his home country's lax justice system to travel to France instead. This picture was the last taken of nine-year-old Chloe at 2.31pm - she is seated in front of her family home. Relatives have put this photograph at the scene where she was kidnapped . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. But he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Nine-year-old Chloe, seen in a last haunting photo posing with a carefree grin in the playground outside her home, was snatched as her terror-stricken mother tried helplessly to reach her. Huminski has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (pictured) Before Isabelle Hyart could do anything, Huminski bundled Chloe into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. He was convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early in March 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Ms Hyart, a mother of two other young children, said: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' Ms Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: 'How could a foreigner with many previous convictions be allowed to move freely around Calais? There is a clear dysfunction in the way we keep track of repeat offenders.' Last summer, Alice Gross, 14, was murdered by a Latvian builder who moved to the UK after serving a prison sentence for killing his wife. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, spent seven years in jail in Latvia but was still allowed in to Britain without having his record checked. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.' The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken .

The 38-year-old shows no remorse during the formal charges, likely to result in a life sentence.
Huminski, banned from France due to earlier offenses, attacked the girl while on his way to England from Calais.
Despite admitting involvement in the crimes, he does not provide reasons for his actions or show remorse.
Thousands join a 'White March' to pay tribute to the victim, Chloe, whose funeral is scheduled for Wednesday.
Huminski had a criminal record in France and Poland and exploited the lax justice system to avoid prison in Poland.
The brutal abduction occurred in broad daylight, leaving the victim's mother horrified and devastated.
Authorities call for a full investigation into Huminski's past, questioning the system's failure to track repeat offenders. </Summary>"
"<document> Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up in front of the Kabul Bank in Jalalabad early Saturday, a local government spokesman said. The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. ""The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,"" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of ""Khorasan."" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. ""The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,"" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. ""You do have some of the Taliban breaking off and claiming allegiance toward ISIS,"" Campbell said, attributing the phenomenon partly to a feeling of disenfranchisement on the parts of some Taliban members -- who, he said, may use ISIS tactics to gain media attention. CNN's Brian Walker, Ben Brumfield and Don Melvin contributed to this report. </document> <Summary> Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up in front of the Kabul Bank in Jalalabad early Saturday, a local government spokesman said.

"<document> Much has been made of U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to support India's push for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which was offered during his November trip to India, but the real story from his visit was its implications for bilateral military trade. During the trip, Obama announced that the United States would sell $5 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to India, including ten Boeing C-17 military transport aircraft and 100 General Electric F-414 fighter aircraft. Although the details are still being worked out, these and other contracts already in the works will propel the United States into the ranks of India's top three military suppliers, alongside Russia and Israel. With India planning to buy $100 billion worth of new weapons over the next ten years, arms sales may be the best way for the United States to revive stagnating U.S.-Indian relations. Even as nonmilitary trade and investment and social and cultural ties between India and the United States have advanced in recent years, Washington remains of two minds about its relationship with New Delhi. In 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush granted India an unprecedented nuclear deal, offering to assist India's civilian nuclear program in contravention of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The nuclear deal convinced many Indians that the United States could be a viable long-term partner. Bush's adamant resistance to Chinese and international nonproliferation advocates' pressure to abandon the deal cemented his status in India, as did his rebuffs of Pakistani demands for similar treatment. </document> <Summary> Much has been made of U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to support India's push for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which was offered during his November trip to India, but the real story from his visit was its implications for bilateral military trade.

"<document> Speaker 2: So we'll go through these seven items, hopefully expeditiously. Item 27, please.
Speaker 1: Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilwoman Allen. Councilwoman Sara. Recommendation to request City Attorney to draft a resolution in opposition to the recall election of the governor of California.
Speaker 2: Of Vice Mayor Richardson. And on the motion, please.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr.. A second. Proceed. Please. Thank you. Between now and September 14th, Californians are voting in an election that will determine the direction that we take in California and impact our community here in Long Beach and even in our country at large.
Speaker 5: In this election, voters ask the question on your ballot, shall Gavin Newsom be recalled removed from office of governor? Yes or no? That is a ballot measure question that has tremendous impacts on our city. Like any other ballot question, we have the legal authority and I believe the responsibility to demonstrate leadership and take a position that best
Speaker 5: aligns with Long Beach's goals and values. Many residents might ask, what is what does this vote actually mean for the future of Long Beach? I want everyone to know that the stakes are indeed high for quality of life, for the initiatives that we've pursued to create a more just, a more equitable city, a more inclusive Long Beach
Speaker 5: , where every resident is accepted and has an opportunity to thrive. And let's talk about what's at stake. All we need to do is look at the recall supporters statement of reasons. Those advocating for a yes vote say that the governor's support for immigrant rights, conservation and investing in housing and services have to stave off a homelessness emergency
Speaker 5: . Are the wrong things to do. Here in Long Beach. We've done the opposite. We welcome immigrants. We've shown this throughout our history as a city. Most recently, by passing our laws that protect our immigrants and helping reunite migrant families.
Speaker 5: We believe that climate change is real. As a city, we need to prepare for its effects. It's why Long Beach has led the way by creating a climate action adaptation plan and passing measure us to help fund these efforts.
Speaker 5: And we know that the K-Shaped recovery from COVID 19 is also real. While the wealthiest among us continue to do well, we've helped our residents, our residents on the lower leg of that case. We're struggling to recover. We've helped them by providing rental assistance and have so have helped support struggling small businesses who need more support, particularly
Speaker 5: through this COVID 19 pandemic. The progress that we've made as a city as a result, it's a result of us working together with our state and federal government to bring resources back to our communities. That's the progress that is on the line.
Speaker 5: The recall process is intended for youth. When a governor cannot fulfill their duty, fulfill their duty due to personal corruption or unfaithfulness for office. And these are not the reasons that are that the recall supporters have put forward in their petition.
Speaker 5: That's not the reasons. In fact, it's important to recognize that this recall petition started circulating months before COVID 19 even reached our shores. And make no mistake, supporters of this recall seek to unravel the progress that we've made as a city in our fight against COVID 19.
Speaker 5: The Long Beach can't afford to sit this one out. The progress we've made in the city is is too important, and it's on the line. So now is the time for us to take a position, our city's future, and make sure that we understand that this recall election is happening.
Speaker 5: This isn't whether or not we want this recall election, how this is happening. And so we need to respond to this with urgency and take a position of no on question one for the seventh, the September 14th recall election.
Speaker 5: And so I'm happy to move our position of no for the city of Long Beach, a position in opposition of the recall election for the governor of California. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Councilman Allen.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. This election, this recall election is a power grab by special interest who hope to delegitimize the votes that were cast in 2018. It delegitimizes my vote for the governor. This recall election will cost over a quarter of $1,000,000,000.
Speaker 1: And that's a, quote, equivalent to more than half of our general fund. Just for reference. This is a waste of time, energy and money by bet, by special interest. And this is dangerous for our democracy.
Speaker 2: Councilwoman. Councilmember Superman.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Independent of the comments made by my colleagues. I have to make this statement. The recall process is clearly outlined in the California Constitution, Article three, Sections 13 through 19, and in the California elections code. It provides a mechanism for the public to attempt to remove elected public officials from office before the end of their terms
Speaker 5: . I have taken the oath of office on three occasions to serve on the Long Beach City Council. Each time I raise my right hand and I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the State of California, I believe that supporting this agenda item would be a clear violation of my oath of office.
Speaker 5: Therefore, I will be voting in opposition. Thank you.
Speaker 2: They can count. Remember, there's a motion in a second. There is no public comment. Members of his court and Castro notes.

Speaker 6: Well, first off.
Speaker 8: Thanks, Councilman Brooks, for inviting us. My name is Steven Jones as my partner Tim Arquilla. And we're here representing Hive Industries. This is a nonprofit event, space and resource center that we've developed over the last four years. Now finding it's home at 725 West 39th and the Fox.
Speaker 8: Fox, what is it, Fox Island near here. But so our concept is based off social capitalism. We think social capitalism is a real thing. And we've created an ecosystem where every entertainment dollar that comes into our building, a portion of that goes to supporting nonprofits and community organizations.
Speaker 8: So as well as artists and musicians. So as a five points Denver native, a product of Denver public schools. The. Sorry my heart is pounding. First time public speaking exactly. A product of Denver. Denver School of the Arts.
Speaker 8: You know, we wanted to create an ecosystem and a organization that supported artists and young community organizations. So that's what the hive industry is. The event center is called the Fox Street Compound. We offer nonprofit consulting program, Incubation Resource Exchange, all in this four acre event field, the old power rental building.
Speaker 8: So but one of the wonderful things that we've created is called Give Back Tickets that sits on top of our nonprofit resource space. It's a social impact platform. It sells tickets, but just like it says, give back tickets, a portion of those service fees go to community benefactors, which is really cool because, you know, obviously everybody pays
Speaker 8: service fees with tickets, but how can we yeah, how can we help organizations? See what else we got here. We have office space, so currently we house five nonprofits, all very young nonprofits. One is Plant the Seed, a project that we'll be producing this summer is the ugly food farmer's market at our event center.
Speaker 8: So every Wednesday we'll have a farmer's market of basically that ugly food, food that doesn't make it to the store shelves of King Soopers and everybody else. So uptake I think growers organic plant the seed and the factory compound.
Speaker 8: We'll be providing that service within our community, servicing the Swansea Globeville district and the Sunnyside area there. We also have a community garden space up on 38th and Sheridan that we've had for about four years and have fostered many great programs with, you know, developing youth and and growing.
Speaker 8: So we're just here to share our vision and say hello, basically.
Speaker 0: Great. And see what can you show us at one site that shows how many thousands of people come to this site?
Speaker 8: Yeah. So our biggest fundraiser brings 25,000 people to the site over a two day period. It's called the Denver Taco Festival and.
Speaker 6: Tacos, right? Yeah.
Speaker 8: Yeah. And so that event itself started in the Reno district and has moved from the 32nd and Larimer block over to this area. And over the four years that it's been running, we've raised over $300,000 for nonprofit organizations, and we have a handful of other events coming to great.
Speaker 0: And I wanted you know, this council sees many rezonings in this Fox Island area, but few people really know what's actually going on in the existing infrastructure and how that existing infrastructure is being used. And so I thought it was important that folks here on council in the city understands that there are folks who are making the
Speaker 0: existing infrastructure work for the community, for folks who are there right now. So that's great.

Speaker 9: Yes. I also wanted to comment again, this is this is great. And I think this is a great move forward for the the third district in the green belt there. An examiner I used to actually live a short distance away from there.
Speaker 9: And I remember when that that issue was debated significantly over whether or not they were going to put a housing development there or keep it as a green space. And so to have this move forward, to finally have some hopefully have some funds there to to develop that that space, I think, is really, really great.
Speaker 9: And I also want to commend Parks and Recreation for coming to the council with this to get the authority to to go out and get the grant. Because I think there's there's some consistency there that we need to continue to follow.

I want to thank our Parks Rec and Marine staff for assisting us with this project. This is a project that the Belmont Heights community has been working on for some time now, and the staff has been very creative and trying to find ways for us to obtain grant funding in order to be able to complete at least one phase of this project. And I want to thank their team and also the new team that's joined us from Public Works in trying to get this this additional money to help make this project a reality.

"<document> Dundee United have hit back at fierce criticism of the board's performance by two leading supporters' groups. Arabtrust and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters Clubs say they are 'shocked' that 25 per cent of £6.3million worth of transfer fees for Ryan Gauld, Andrew Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. The supporters groups also disputed chairman Stephen Thompson's alleged level of investment in the club. The Dundee United board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on-field success . The Tannadice club - already under fire for selling Armstrong and Mackay-Steven to Celtic six weeks before their League Cup final defeat to the Scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement. It read: 'All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club. 'This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field. 'On the field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. 'The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.' The supporters' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts, saying: 'Despite the sales of the four players the board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.' Defending their record on that point, the club statement responded: 'Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2m in February 2014 to £2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt. The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4m by the end of this year. 'Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters. They bring with them a wealth of experience in business. 'At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.' Arabtrust and the Federation also voiced concerns that chairman Thompson was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family's shareholding drop below 75 per cent. The most explosive allegation, however, is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties – none of whom are understood to be players, agents or other clubs. The supporters' joint statement added: 'We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25 per cent of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.' United last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the Bank of Scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of August 2015. A United spokesman said: 'We've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words, but the £500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption. At no time was that figure provided to anyone, so it's surprising to see it in the public domain.' Some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received . </document> <Summary> Dundee United have hit back at fierce criticism of the board's performance by two leading supporters' groups.

"<document> Jan. 30 (UPI) -- The U.S. State Department has approved Japan's $2.15 billion purchase of two land-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense systems. On Tuesday, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale. Defense News reported it was the first foreign military sales announcement since the end of a 35-day partial government shutdown. The Defense Department was not closed during the shutdown, but the State Department, which was shuttered, needed to approve the deal. Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems is the primary contractor for the Aegis Weapon System and Multi-Mission Signal Processors. General Dynamics will provide the Command and Control Processor Refresh. Also included are radio navigation equipment, ordnance, IFF systems, and construction services for six vertical launch system launcher module enclosures. ""This proposed sale will provide the government of Japan with an enhanced capability against increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile threats and create an expanded, layered defense of its homeland,"" the State Department said in a news release. ""Japan, which already has the AEGIS in its inventory, will have no difficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces."" The State Department noted the United States must assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability, especially against North Korea. In addition, the arms ""will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region."" To fund the systems, Japan's defense budget will grow to $47 billion in fiscal 2019, starting in April, the government announced last month. Japan already has the seventh-largest defense budget in the world, and it's about 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Conversely, China and the United States spend between 2 and 3 percent of their gross domestic products annually on defense. On Jan. 20, Japan's Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya visited a U.S. Defense Department facility on Kauai island, Hawaii, the test site for the Aegis Ashore land-based missile interception system. He was given information on the missile system's functionality. ""I am convinced that introducing Aegis Ashore will strengthen our defense capabilities against a missile attack,"" Iwaya said to the media after visiting the facility. ""We will steadily proceed with introduction of the system."" The government plans to deploy the systems in Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures. Akita Prefecture is in northwestern Honshu on the Sea of Japan coast with about 308,000 people. ""Why the Defense Ministry chose Araya as a site for Aegis Ashore is a mystery,"" Kozo Kazama, who leads a local group opposed to the Aegis plan, told Japan Times. ""Unlike the other candidate site in Yamaguchi, which is located away from a major urban center, Araya is in a major city. ""There are so many concerns about the effects of the radar on both electronic devices in the area and on stress levels, as well as all sorts of security concerns related to the presence of missiles so close to so many people,"" Kazama said. In August, Defense Ministry officials told Akita residents about 200 personnel, as well as radar facilities and missile launchers, would be stationed at the Aegis Ashore site. At the other site, the town of Abu lies deep in the Yamaguchi Prefecture countryside, about a 30-minute drive from the port city of Hagi. ""There are concerns about radio waves from the Aegis radar and whether cellphone reception and television sets would be affected,"" said Sumiko Hara, 75, one of the leaders of the local opposition. And you can't say that there's been a sufficient investigation into the effects of the Aegis Ashore on human health."" Also, part of the area is classified as an active volcano zone, including a lava plateau. ""Unfortunately, as this is a Defense Ministry project, the local governments are limited in what they can do and the central government can keep much information secret,"" said Rota Asai, a member of the Hagi Municipal Assembly. On Tuesday, James H. Anderson, the assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities, outlined the U.S. missile defense strategy during a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Anderson said the strategy covers lethality, partnership and reform. He noted in the presentation that China and Russia are developing advanced cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons that can potentially overcome U.S. defenses. To address regional threats and protect partner nations, the United States has looked to deploy additional missile defense assets, including both Patriot and Aegis systems as ""partner nations are building up their air and missile defenses, with the possibility of integrating them with U.S. systems"" -- including those deployed or under construction in Romania, Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands. ""Diplomacy and deterrence are the primary strategies to protect the nation, deployed forces and U.S. allies from missile attacks,"" according to a Defense Department summary of the presentation. ""Should that fail, the U.S. is developing a layered missile defense system as well as offensive capability."" </document> <Summary> The U.S Department has approved Japans $2.15 billion purchase of two land-based  Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence system.

"<document> Dozens of public servants were less than humoured when they were told their jobs would be lost in a cruel April Fools' Day prank. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were given an 'announcement' on a big TV screen that their workplace was being closed and moved to Melbourne. DFAT has since reprimanded the staff member responsible for the stunt, which saw 30 low-ranking employees told they needed to apply for expressions of interest if they wanted to keep their jobs by moving to Melbourne. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were met with this 'announcement' on a big TV screen . The message was displayed for five hours before one of the centre's supervisors told workers that it was an April Fools' Day prank. The workers had good cause to fear for their jobs: DFAT is planning to cut 500 jobs by June. The main role of the employees involved in the parnk is to ensure passport applicants meet the requirements in a process known as 'ELLO'. The announcement said the office was undergoing 'substantial' changes and would be moving all 'ELLO' roles to Melbourne as a result. It comes as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradeplans plans to cut 500 jobs by June this year . The Community and Public Sector Union's national secretary Nadine Flood said it was tasteless to joke about something perceived as a genuine fear, according to The Guardian.

"<document> I hope when you were sitting at home in front of your tellies  looking forward to the latest instalment of the Arsene vs Jose show that you remembered all important thing: this classic managerial match-up is no capital club sprint, it’s a London derby marathon. And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo. His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout. Instead, we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table. And a description of John Terry’s performance as ‘from the moon.’ Mourinho patrols the touchline as the Chelsea boss saw his side take another step toward the title . Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one. Something Sky Sports spotted early on was the deal, and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed. And why should they? After all, everyone will be back next year for more of the same. So what’s the rush? </document> <Summary> This year, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. </Summary>"

Most of us know the members of the Avengers by now: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and the rest, and the fact that a few more like Quicksilver are joining the cast in the ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" sequel. But there was one character who remained a mystery: the Vision, to be played by Paul Bettany. Thus far, we've only seen his eyes in a trailer. With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Meanwhile, as many Marvel fans know, Thursday was the eve of the new Netflix series ""Daredevil,"" and after a photoshopped first look at Charlie Cox's iconic red Daredevil suit went out, Marvel put out a video of the real one. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel.

"<document> The heartbroken mother of Becky Watts has spoken of her fear of coming face-to-face with Anje Galsworthy - whose son is accused of the teenager's murder. Tania Watts is likely to see her at Becky's funeral, as Ms Galsworthy was also stepmother to the 16-year-old. Speaking to ITV today, Ms Watts spoke of the 'hell' she has endured since the murder, adding: 'I'm still in the back of my mind not accepting...that I'm not going to see her.' Murdered: The body parts of Becky Watts, 16, were found at house in Bristol on March 2 and police charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder . Dreading meeting: Becky's heartbroken mother Tani Watts said she fears coming face-to-face with Anjie Galsworthy, (pictured with Becky's father Darren) whose son is accused of the teenager's murder . Becky, 16, vanished from her father's family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19, sparking a huge search operation. Police discovered her body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2 and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. In an ITV interview, Ms Watts described her daughter as a 'caring, normal, happy, lovely girl'. She said: 'She made you feel alive. Everyone loved her. Knowing it's happened, it's like you are talking about someone else's kid. 'You shouldn't have to bury a child. There are a lot of people on this Earth who don't deserve to be here but Becky was not one of them. 'She should be here.' Accused: Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews is set to go on trial for the 16-year-old's murder . Mr Matthews is pictured in fancy dress alongside his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, who is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police . Becky grew up with her parents - mother Ms Watts and father Darren Galsworthy - living in separate homes but often tried to bring them together. Ms Watts added: 'That was her aim to make sure we all got on and this is why it was so upsetting because she succeeded in that. 'The one person who was so loyal, so caring and loved us all equally has now gone.' Ms Watts said her daughter was a regular guest at her home, visiting twice a week or so depending on her busy social life. 'She had some hard times in the past, she was very insecure, unconfident, but she got her confidence back and she got a bit of fight in her,' she said. Ms Watts cannot comprehend how, Nathan Matthews, the man accused of her daughter's murder comes from within the 16 year old's home - and she is understandably nervous about seeing his mother, Ms Galsworthy.

Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article. </document> <Summary> Becky, 16, vanished from her father's family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19, sparking a huge search operation.
Police discovered her body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2 and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. 
 In an ITV interview, Ms Watts described her daughter as a 'caring, normal, happy, lovely girl'.
Becky grew up with her parents - mother Ms Watts and father Darren Galsworthy - living in separate homes but often tried to bring them together.
Ms Watts cannot comprehend how, Nathan Matthews, the man accused of her daughter's murder comes from within the 16 year old's home - and she is understandably nervous about seeing his mother, Ms Galsworthy.
Becky's family home - where she lived with Mr and Mrs Galsworthy - has been the subject of forensic searches since she was reported missing on February 20.
Anjie and Darren Galsworthy are pictured speaking in a video appeal one week after the 16-year-old's disappearance.

"<document> Yaya Toure's agent has called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'weak manager' and criticised the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain. Toure's performances have come under the microscope amid a dismal run for City which has seen them go from title contenders to being in a battle simply to finish in the top four. But agent Dimitri Seluk has claimed the club are trying to make Toure a scapegoat for bigger problems behind the scenes. The agent of Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) has called Manuel Pellegrini, his manager, 'weak' Pellegrini has struggled this with the  champions this season, and Dimitri Seluk has placed blame on him . 'Some people at City are trying to blame Yaya for what has happened this season,' he said. 'But those people aren't taking responsibility for their own mistakes. 'I am talking about executives who have bought players for a lot of money - and then put those players on the bench. Executives who spend a lot of money on Stevan Jovetic and then drop him from the Champions League squad. I feel sorry for Pellegrini. He's a good coach, but a weak manager. 'He won the title with the team left behind by (predecessor) Roberto Mancini.' Toure, whose relationship with the club came under strain last summer, has been linked with a move away this summer, with Mancini making clear his interest in signing the 31-year-old for Inter Milan. Seluk said that it was wrong to criticise Toure over City's struggles and blamed the manager and executives . Pellegrini was described as a good coach but a weak manager by Toure's agent in a scathing attack . 'If City want Yaya to leave, they should come out and say so,' Seluk told the Sunday Mirror. 'Two of the biggest clubs have already asked me if he is available, and I know that if City would sell, another 10 would call me inside 24 hours.' City go into Sunday afternoon's match against West Ham four points above fifth-placed Liverpool and with the pressure firmly on Pellegrini. Txiki Begiristain (left) Manchester City's director of football, Ferran Soriano (centre) the CEO were criticised . Seluk picked out the decision to buy Stevan Jovetic and then leave him out of the Champions League squad . The Chilean has maintained he is not worried about his job, but admitted that could change if they dropped out of the Champions League places. 'You are wrong if you think that, at this club, if you don't win the title then you are out,' he said in a number of national newspapers. 'If we miss the top four then maybe it will be different because that would not be the same thing, the analysis of the season will be different.' </document> <Summary> Yaya Toure's agent criticizes Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, calling him a 'weak manager,' and targets the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain.
The agent defends Toure, stating that the club is trying to make him a scapegoat for larger problems behind the scenes, and blames the executives for poor decisions, such as leaving expensive players like Stevan Jovetic on the bench.
Toure's future at Manchester City is uncertain, with interest from other clubs like Inter Milan.
The agent challenges City to be clear if they want Toure to leave, as other clubs have already expressed interest in him. </Summary>"

Of these 54 cases, only 27 have more than minimal evidence that a terrorist group actually acquired, attempted to acquire, or threatened to use a bioweapon. Eight of these cases produced evidence that the terrorist group actually acquired the agent, but in only five cases did terrorists confirm the use or attempted use of biological weapons (Carus, 2002). The five cases of bioterrorists Carus mentions are the Rajneeshees, Aum Shinrikyo, Dark Harvest, Mau Mau, and the Polish Resistance.

"<document> A sweeping revision of state highway plans adds nearly $9 billion in new funds for improving Texas roadways, including a $1.32 billion infusion in the Houston area for a major overhaul of Interstate 45 and nine other projects. Projects along Texas 36 in Fort Bend and Brazoria counties and Texas 105 in Montgomery and San Jacinto counties were also included in the unified transportation plan approved Tuesday in Austin by the Texas Transportation Commission. ""This is a major step forward,"" said Commissioner Bruce Bugg. The newly approved plan adds 230 projects and $8.9 billion in funding statewide. The plan - updated annually in phases - guides all state highway, maritime and aviation spending. Projects across the state show up first in the plan, with the money for them tied to upcoming fiscal years for the Texas Department of Transportation. All the projects are dwarfed by the I-45 project. Last month, officials called it the type of project that comes around once every 50 years. ""We are trying to make long-term improvements, and we believe we've made them,"" said Quincy Allen, TxDOT Houston district director. Construction set to begin In the Houston area, the updated plan marks a massive increase in highway investment, primarily through a windfall of money from two voter-approved highway spending proposals in 2014 and 2015 that accelerated the redesign of Interstate 45 through Houston's central business district. ""Houston's problems are in the downtown area first and foremost,"" said Lauren Garduno, TxDOT's director of project and planning and development. Construction is expected to start in late 2020 on the first of seven separate projects that will realign I-45 along downtown's eastern side, parallel to Interstate 69, also known as U.S. 59 in the Houston area. Typically, construction begins about three to four months after bids are opened. If that timing holds, two months after I-45 work moves south, drivers frustrated on their way to Austin when westbound Interstate 10 drops to two lanes in Brookshire will start seeing orange cones. Crews will widen the freeway to three lanes in each direction to the Brazos River. Just before or after the holiday season, work will begin on a third project to reconstruct some of the connections where I-69 crosses Loop 610 near Uptown, as well as rebuild Loop 610 through the intersection.TxDOT expects all of the projects to finish in 2021, around the time downtown interchanges will start to see significant construction. Funding uncertain As they cheered the upcoming investments, state transportation officials also sounded a note of caution. While the commission can program money, they do so with what state budget writers — members of the Legislature — provide in upcoming budgets. Some state lawmakers have already discussed holding back on some of the spending related to Proposition 1, which voters approved in 2014, directing money from the state's so-called rainy day fund. Uncertainty also clouds federal money, another major source of how Texas widens roads, said transportation Commissioner Jeff Austin. Transportation commissioner Victor Vandergriff urged officials to keep in mind it will take many decisions in Austin and potentially in local communities to keep many projects moving toward construction, and not all of them will make it. The facts are there are never enough dollars out there for every project and we are going to be limited at the state level with what we can do,"" Vandergriff said, noting a host of funding alternatives and considerations about how to expand roads.n ""We know we are going to have to address that,"" he said. ""Not us, the state of Texas."" </document> <Summary> A sweeping revision of state highway plans adds nearly $9 billion in new funds for improving Texas roadways, including a $1.32 billion infusion in the Houston area for a major overhaul of Interstate 45 and nine other projects.

"<document> The biggest single problem in societies aspiring to be democratic has been their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services (especially education, health care and infrastructure) that are needed to achieve individual opportunity. Proponents of democracy focus, for understandable reasons, on limiting the powers of tyrannical or predatory states. But they don't spend as much time thinking about how to govern effectively. They are, in Woodrow Wilson's phrase, more interested in ""controlling than in energizing government."" This was the failure of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which toppled Viktor Yanukovych for the first time. The leaders who came to power through those protests—Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko—wasted their energy on internal squabbling and shady deals. Had an effective democratic administration come to power, cleaning up corruption in Kiev and making the state's institutions more trustworthy, the government might have established its legitimacy across Ukraine, including the Russian-speaking east, long before Mr. Putin was strong enough to interfere. Instead, the democratic forces discredited themselves and paved the way for Mr. Yanukovych's return in 2010, thus setting the stage for the tense, bloody standoff of recent months. India has been held back by a similar gap in performance when compared with authoritarian China. It is very impressive that India has held together as a democracy since its founding in 1947. But Indian democracy, like sausage-making, doesn't look very appealing on closer inspection. The system is rife with corruption and patronage; 34% of the winners of India's recent elections have criminal indictments pending against them, according to India's Association for Democratic Reforms, including serious charges like murder, kidnapping and sexual assault. The rule of law exists in India, but it is so slow and ineffective that many plaintiffs die before their cases come to trial. The Indian Supreme Court has a backlog of more than 60,000 cases, according to the Hindustan Times. Compared with autocratic China, the world's largest democracy has been completely hamstrung in its ability to provide modern infrastructure or basic services such as clean water, electricity or basic education to its population. In some Indian states, 50% of schoolteachers fail to show up for work, according to the economist and activist Jean Drèze. Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist with a troubling past of tolerating anti-Muslim violence, has just been elected prime minister by an impressive majority in the hope that he will somehow cut through all the blather of routine Indian politics and actually get something done. Americans, more than other people, often fail to understand the need for effective government, focusing instead on the constraint of authority. In 2003, the George W. Bush administration seemed to believe that democratic government and a market-oriented economy would spontaneously emerge in Iraq once the U.S. had eliminated Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. It didn't understand that these arise from the interaction of complex institutions—political parties, courts, property rights, shared national identity—that have evolved in developed democracies over many decades, even centuries. The inability to govern effectively extends, unfortunately, to the U.S. itself. Our Madisonian Constitution, deliberately designed to prevent tyranny by multiplying checks and balances at all levels of government, has become a vetocracy. In the polarized—indeed poisonous—political atmosphere of today's Washington, the government has proved unable to move either forward or backward effectively. Contrary to the hysterics on either side, the U.S. faces a very serious long-term fiscal problem that is nonetheless solvable through sensible political compromises. But Congress hasn't passed a budget, according to its own rules, in several years, and last fall, the GOP shut down the entire government because it couldn't agree on paying for past debts. Though the U.S. economy remains a source of miraculous innovation, American government is hardly a source of inspiration around the world at the present moment. Twenty-five years later, the most serious threat to the end-of-history hypothesis isn't that there is a higher, better model out there that will someday supersede liberal democracy; neither Islamist theocracy nor Chinese capitalism cuts it.

Speaker 4: Mike. Everybody in Congress Park is so excited about that pool and you see so many comments and feedback and I'm so glad this is coming through tonight and looking forward to the development of that new pool. Congressman, so I appreciate all you're doing to keep it open this year and help design it.
Speaker 4: Just want to ask you question is how you're going to include the community in the involvement of the design process. Please?
Speaker 6: Sure. So we are intending to begin our public process this summer while the pool is still open. And we're targeting a date in late July or early August on the weekend to get down there when families are out enjoying the pool and get some real active feedback from them before it closes for the summer.
Speaker 4: That's great. Well, it's going to be a real asset once it's developed, so we're really looking forward to it. So thank you. Thank you very much. Okay.

"<document> Andy Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of Aljaz Bedene into the home ranks: don’t complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene’s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. ‘If he was 500 in the world they wouldn’t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,’ said the 27-year-old Scot. ‘And he’s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. ‘So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He’s British now so they’ve just got to deal with it. ‘I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. ‘He’s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he’s on the tour every week, the other guys aren’t quite there yet.’ Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: ‘He’s a good player with a very good serve. He’s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he’s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it’s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. ‘He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don’t know exactly how high he can go. I’ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven’t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he’s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.’ Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times — but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: ‘To have another player in the men’s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz’s change in citizenship.’ Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans’s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering £27,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word. The Great Britain Davis Cup team celebrate their victory against the USA in Glasgow last month . </document> <Summary> don’t complain. 
Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. 
At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene’s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation.  </Summary>"
"<document> The ECB are not living up to their promise of fresh transparency under a new regime by keeping secret the job description for the director of England cricket. The confidential details were sent by email to potential candidates for the post, front-runners for which are former England captains Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart. But the work parameters will not appear on the ECB website or that of headhunters Sports Recruitment International, as would be the normal procedure. ECB chairman Colin Graves has released very few details of the new director of cricket role for England . Former England captain Andrew Strauss (pictured here in 2011) is among the front-runners for the job . It is understood the ECB, who say there will be a proper recruitment procedure, don't want any publicity about the job specification. It might well be altered in various ways during the interview process so their chosen man is happy with the scope of his responsibilities. It is not expected that the new appointment will have to go to every England game. That will please head coach Peter Moores, who talked of the danger of having too many voices in the dressing room after the Antigua Test. But the cricket director will have the main say over coach and captain and set the overall playing strategy. Sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who is credited with having helped Jonathan Trott recover from situational anxieties well enough for him to return to the Test arena, talked briefly this week about how he is aiding the England batsman. England star Jonathan Trott has overcome situational anxieties following work with psychiatrist Steve Peters . Peters, before giving a lecture on his role as undergraduate dean of the University of Sheffield medical school, said he wasn't equipped to give guidance on the technical batting problems that led to Trott's two failures in Antigua. But he concentrates on ensuring, through Skype sessions, that Trott is in the best state of mind to succeed while being able to put any cricket setback into proper perspective. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho appears to have enjoyed yet another big payday by fronting a Jaguar promotion of their new car supply deal for the Wimbledon Championships. Mourinho, who was shown around the All England Club by chairman-in-waiting and fellow Jaguar ambassador Tim Henman, is a tennis fan who goes to the World Tour finals at the O2 and counts Rafa Nadal as a friend, even inviting him to Chelsea matches. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has begun fronting a new promotional campaign on behalf of Jaguar . It has emerged that Keith Pelley, the Canadian media mogul chosen as chief executive of golf's European Tour, was not the only non-European in the running. So was the second choice, and there was also an American on the short-list. The message seems to have been that the Tour didn't want to antagonise the rest of Europe by appointing another Brit following the long, successful reigns of Ken Schofield and George O'Grady. However, Pelley, despite his lack of golf knowledge, is seen as a good appointment, mainly because of his TV rights acumen. Keith Pelley (right) O'Sullivan going to pot? Five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who has suffered from depression and missed most of the 2012-13 season with personal issues, doesn't seem to be in the best frame of mind ahead of this year's World Championship judging by a call he made while on the London-Sheffield train last Saturday. O'Sullivan leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the World Championships . The Rocket, who leads debutant Craig Steadman 7-2 in his first-round match, was overhead saying that he wasn't happy and was ready to retire again. O'Sullivan said in hearing of around 10 passengers travelling in the same first-class carriage: 'It's no good. I don't need any of this. I've got my Eurosport work, I've got money. I only came back to revive my career. Tony McCoy, the greatest ever jump jockey who retires from riding at Sandown on Saturday, has an open offer to join Channel 4, who would greatly benefit from his stardust. But McCoy, although sure to make occasional TV appearances, is more likely to work inside JP McManus' racing empire. Legendary jockey AP McCoy is set to retire from racing on Saturday and could now pursue punditry . With so many Premier League clubs having absentee owners, it's refreshing to hear that Etty Smith, the 95-year-old mother of Norwich majority shareholder Delia, still regularly attends games at Carrow Road. </document> <Summary> The ECB are not living up to their promise of fresh transparency under a new regime by keeping secret the job description for the director of England cricket.

"<document> Speaker 0: One nay 11 AIS Resolution 1291 has been adopted. All right, Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens. And Councilman Hines, you had to comment on this one on 1330.
Speaker 4: Yes, Mr. President, go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. And this is a comment in the in the. But the purpose is full transparency. So just for what it's worth, next week, unless I hear good reason. Otherwise, I will propose an amendment to 19 Dash 1330.
Speaker 4: Specifically, I intend to propose a narrow amendment requiring a one hour response time for elevator companies when someone has become trapped in an elevator due to a power or mechanical failure. This is a result of multiple complaints by constituents in districts nine and ten.
Speaker 4: And I did touch base with Councilman CdeBaca in advance to verify that this is the case. And these two districts of the two districts with the most elevators in the city. As we continue to grow, as the city will continue to need additional elevators that function correctly.
Speaker 4: And in case you already know, in case excuse me in case you don't already know, Denver fire reports needing to rescue eight people each day in Denver from trapped elevators. Denver Fire also reports that a common report is that the phones in those elevators that are stuck also do not work.
Speaker 4: Denver excuse me? Denver Airport reports that their minutes contract has a ten minute response time. And and certainly they pay for that response time. But the point is that elevator companies can respond. And, of course, you know, there's a there's a financial component there.
Speaker 4: But but there's a financial component in any maintenance contract, particularly, or as an example, the maintenance contract that that my HRA has with our elevator company is there's a financial component. So Denver Fire reports that this response time is in line with other industries.
Speaker 4: So this is not out of out of purpose. And and just part of the reason why I'm making this public today is because we reached out multiple times to the elevator companies. And after this went through Ludy, we reached out and the response was, quote, Due to vacation and travel schedule, I will not be available until January
Speaker 4: ten. Quote, It is impossible for us to have a dialog with an industry that that cannot be available until after this is passed. So so I'm putting it out here that I'm soliciting input from anyone who thinks that this this amendment is not prudent.
Speaker 4: The last thing I'd say is that I just I won't go back over this because I already mentioned it in Ludie and committee, but I shared several concerns about. Elevators. Elevator maintenance and the relationship between proper elevator maintenance and having to rescue people from broken elevators.
Speaker 4: So if you have any concerns or comments or input about elevators or elevator maintenance or any reason why we should not have a one hour response time in line with every other industry, please reach out to the District ten office.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Since you called this out, I'm just going to quickly say outside of elevators, there is a lot to be excited about in this code, especially when it comes to the environment and how our buildings are built and what kind of energy they use and what kind of emissions they release.
Speaker 0: And in addition to that, for the first time ever in Denver, we will have the Denver Green Code, which gets us even closer to where we need to be to be addressing climate change and meeting the science based standards that have been set forward that we need to be meeting as a city lot to be excited about
Speaker 0: in here, even if we have a few kinks to work out before we get it fully approved. But looking forward to that. All right. Next up, Madam Secretary, I believe we're now on to 1341. And Councilman Ortega, I am correct in remembering that you are the one called out for a vote.

And in case you already know, in case excuse me in case you don't already know, Denver fire reports needing to rescue eight people each day in Denver from trapped elevators. Denver Fire also reports that a common report is that the phones in those elevators that are stuck also do not work.
Denver excuse me? Denver Airport reports that their minutes contract has a ten minute response time. And and certainly they pay for that response time. But the point is that elevator companies can respond. And, of course, you know, there's a there's a financial component there.
But but there's a financial component in any maintenance contract, particularly, or as an example, the maintenance contract that that my HRA has with our elevator company is there's a financial component. So Denver Fire reports that this response time is in line with other industries.
So this is not out of out of purpose. And and just part of the reason why I'm making this public today is because we reached out multiple times to the elevator companies. And after this went through Ludy, we reached out and the response was, quote, Due to vacation and travel schedule, I will not be available until January
ten. Quote, It is impossible for us to have a dialog with an industry that that cannot be available until after this is passed. So so I'm putting it out here that I'm soliciting input from anyone who thinks that this this amendment is not prudent.
The last thing I'd say is that I just I won't go back over this because I already mentioned it in Ludie and committee, but I shared several concerns about. Elevators. Elevator maintenance and the relationship between proper elevator maintenance and having to rescue people from broken elevators.
So if you have any concerns or comments or input about elevators or elevator maintenance or any reason why we should not have a one hour response time in line with every other industry, please reach out to the District ten office.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Councilman. Since you called this out, I'm just going to quickly say outside of elevators, there is a lot to be excited about in this code, especially when it comes to the environment and how our buildings are built and what kind of energy they use and what kind of emissions they release.
And in addition to that, for the first time ever in Denver, we will have the Denver Green Code, which gets us even closer to where we need to be to be addressing climate change and meeting the science based standards that have been set forward that we need to be meeting as a city lot to be excited about
in here, even if we have a few kinks to work out before we get it fully approved. But looking forward to that. All right. Next up, Madam Secretary, I believe we're now on to 1341. And Councilman Ortega, I am correct in remembering that you are the one called out for a vote. </Summary>"

Speaker 1: Communication from Councilwoman Mongeau, Councilwoman Zendejas Councilmember Your Urunga recommendation directs city manager to review and report back within 90 days on parks, roadway and parking lot maintenance.
Speaker 0: Councilwoman.
Speaker 3: Thank you. I was trying to text. Motion to the Q. Thank you for everyone who has contributed to this item. Our community has really reached out related to some challenges that we have found in understanding how. Potholes that are not on residential and commercial corridors, residential streets, commercial corridors or the other types of public streets that we
Speaker 3: have actually get filled. We've been working on a particular pothole for months, and sometimes these potholes get reported through the garbage out hundreds of times and still no resolution. And that's just not acceptable. I know that interior roads and our park facilities and our our parking lots often have some of the worst potholes in the city.
Speaker 3: And while I'm not looking to pull resources from one area to another, I think it's important for there to be a united method in which people can communicate with the city about a pothole and the need to repair it.
Speaker 3: Because what's happening is a pothole reported at a small size left unrepaired for months on end, actually grows to a size where the cost of repairing that pothole has grown exponentially. So we really need to figure out how to pull together a united pothole program.
Speaker 3: I think that's kind of the theme of my two items tonight, which is understanding that within our city we do a lot of great things, but sometimes they're broken up into different departments and this is one of those times.
Speaker 3: And so I'd like the city manager to look at that and come back and. He's already committed to filling the pothole issue that we have. That's been an ongoing issue, but that issues like this should not be bounced around from public works to Parks and Rec for months on end, with residents feeling totally disenfranchized and frustrated.

"<document> Tesco is close to ditching the last of the private jets used by its top executives after an accounting scandal that sparked the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. Britain’s biggest grocer operated a multimillion-pound fleet of five aircraft for its bosses, but after a disastrous year new chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the planes gave the wrong image and put them up for sale. Four have been sold and the final one, a Hawker 800, will be gone by the end of next month. A similar plane can cost up to £67,000 to charter. Tesco's old Gulfstream 550, worth around £30 million,  that was capable of flying 14 executives at a time . Just days ago, Tesco managed to sell its seven-year-old, Gulfstream 550, worth around £30million new. It was capable of flying 14 executives at a time. With a top speed of 580mph, powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, it was the height of luxury, kitted out with DVD players, widescreen TVs and a bar . It even had cabins allowing executives to sleep in full-sized beds on longer journeys to America and Asia. Mr Lewis hopes the sale of the fleet will draw a line under a difficult year in which Tesco lurched from crisis to crisis, including a fraud investigation into after a £263million black hole emerged in its accounts. The supermarket haemorrhaged senior staff losing its chairman, chief executive and finance director while being hit hard by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen customers. In September Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever. However less than four weeks after informing the City he no longer wanted to maintain the fleet, Lewis could not resist hopping onto a private jet to visit seven locations in Asia in four days. A spokesman said: ‘In October we said we would dispose of the five aircraft we operated. The last aircraft will be handed back by the end of May at the latest. Tesco spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world between 2005 and 2012 . ‘The aircraft have not been used by Tesco since December. In future we will use chartered aircraft only if there is a compelling business justification and travel cannot be completed by scheduled airline.’ Between 2005 and 2012 the firm has spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world. Previous chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has been reported as saying he preferred flights with EasyJet than flying on private jets but still managed to spend £2.3 million on the planes in 2009. The bill increased dramatically under the management of former boss Phil Clarke. In February 2011 under the tenure of Clarke it had jumped to £8.9 million. A brand new Gulfstream was delivered and sold almost immediately in November along with a Cessna Citation and another Hawker. </document> <Summary> Tesco is close to ditching the last of the private jets used by its top executives after an accounting scandal that sparked the biggest crisis in its 95-year history.

That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say 'oh, here are my goals' and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way.

"<document> Speaker 0: Thank you. This is mine. So I will go ahead and first move. I will move to pass Council Bill 120286. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill as a sponsor of this bill.
Speaker 0: I will address this item. Council Bill 120286 is legislation that would authorize several actions related to our two new city holidays. As a reminder, December and December 2021, the city enacted two ordinances relating to two new holidays ordinance 126505 Establish Juneteenth as a legal holiday for non represented city employees and a parking holiday for the public.
Speaker 0: Ordinance number 126516 Establish Juneteenth An Indigenous People's Day as legal holidays for city employees represented by the Coalition of City Unions. Although the city has already established Indigenous People's Day as a day of observance, observance and legal holiday for city employees represented by the Coalition, legislation is required to expand this holiday to non represented city employees and
Speaker 0: establish a parking holiday. The proposed legislation would authorize the following actions. Number one, establish Indigenous People's Day as a legal holiday for city employees on the second Monday of October. Number two, establish indigenous people's day as a parking holiday.
Speaker 0: Number three, approve a memorandum of understanding with three unions to establish Juneteenth, an indigenous peoples day as a new paid holiday. And four make technical updates to facilitate observance of Indigenous Peoples Day. Direct costs would include additional pay for minimum staffing requirements and the loss of on street parking revenue for the parking holiday for each car for
Speaker 0: up to about 132,000 for each parking holiday. Completing the establishment of Indigenous People's Day as a new holiday will demonstrate the city's commitment to honoring the culture and contributions of indigenous people. The establishment of both Juneteenth and the Indigenous Peoples Day will also signal a commitment towards achieving racial equity, working towards an anti-racist future, and ending the
Speaker 0: historical and continued harms towards black Americans and indigenous peoples in this region and the United States. For next steps after Council approves the bill today, the executive will transmit and the executive will later transmit separate budget legislation to appropriate funding to cover the direct costs.
Speaker 0: Those are the costs that are just shared with you. Is there any comments on the bill? I would just like to thank Councilman Morales for bringing the Juneteenth to us. I believe it was in her committee and we passed the legislation.
Speaker 0: So thank you, Castro. Morales So it looks like both holidays will have free parking, so let's be thankful for that. So anyhow, thank you. Not seen any more comments or hands raised. Well, clerk, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 2: The council letter is for an easement right of way connected to 4951 Oregon Avenue. In the staff report, we talk about when the secret document came forward and what's listed as May 9th, 2017. That was a mistake by staff.
Speaker 2: That was actually the date that we brought forward the track map for the development project. The actual secret document came forward in November on the 10th in 2015. So we wanted to read that in the record to make sure it accurately reflects when the secret document was approved so we can move this item forward.

The second involves the ability to limit the intensity of a crisis. How much fiscal capacity does the government have to cushion a fall in private demand, and how much monetary scope does the Federal Reserve have to lower interest rates?

"<document> Speaker 3: Thank you. Agenda Item seven Council Bill 118443. Relating to the rates, terms and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the satellite department to customers in the city of SeaTac and amending SeaTac.
Speaker 0: Thank you Councilmember. So on trying to help you out there. Yes.
Speaker 6: This item also accompanies item number nine. I will go ahead and speak to vote. So I'm speaking to item number seven and nine. City Light has negotiated the new franchise agreement with the City of SeaTac. These are 15 year agreements and you may have noticed that they have all been expiring and have been renegotiated recently.
Speaker 6: There's a standard agreement and this is similar to those standard agreements. There's one thing that's notable. There's something called a consideration payment, which can either be 4% or 6%. This is a fee that is assessed to the customers in that area.
Speaker 6: In this case, the customer is SeaTac. And satellite ads that feed and then hand that revenue over to the city similar to a tax. It has no impact on other customers outside the city. When Sea-Tac renegotiated their franchise agreement, they elected to switch from the 4% consideration payment to a 6% consideration payment.
Speaker 6: And that's why there are two kinds of those. This one adopts the new rates with the consideration payment, and item number nine will adopt a franchise agreement as a whole. And I just wanted to note that as I have advocated here in Seattle, I think the city of sea dogs should alter how they do rate to lessen
Speaker 6: the burden on working families. However, this is what Sea Deck has negotiated, so the Energy Committee unanimously recommends passage of the bill.

"<document> The first use of hegemony in international environmental politics revolves around the use of superior power in the interest of international regime building. Young (1989:88) has argued in International Cooperation: Building Regimes for Natural Resources and the Environment that, even though hegemonic states rarely impose international regimes against the wishes of other states, they play an important role in providing leadership in the creation of mutually agreeable environmental regimes. Although environmental leadership does not necessarily result from hegemonic power, it is closely linked to such power. Environmental leadership can take many different forms: policy entrepreneurship of individual actors in international bargaining that facilitates compromise and agreement in the interest of environmental causes (entrepreneurial leadership); diffusion and role model effects of national environmental policy (intellectual leadership); and the more explicit use of economic incentives and sanctions in pursuit of international environmental objectives (structural leadership) (Young 1991; Lake 1993; Vogel 1997; Tews 2004). Even though hegemony is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the existence of environmental leadership, it is usually only powerful states that have a lasting effect on international negotiations and norm creation. Weaker states may assume a leading position when it comes to developing progressive environmental policies or demanding stringent international rules. But such initiatives will remain ineffective if they are not backed up by political and economic clout that can foster international agreement and induce compliance. For example, smaller European states such as Denmark and the Netherlands have often been in the vanguard of environmental policy innovation, but Germany, Europe's largest economy, is usually credited with providing the essential leadership for advancing environmental policies at the EU level. A similar picture emerges in the international system. It is mainly states that have dominant economic and political clout and whose position in the international economy affords them the possibility of exerting indirect or direct pressure on other states that can provide effective leadership on environmental issues. The United States is a good example of this conclusion. For much of the early phase of international environmental politics, the United States provided international leadership in one form or the other. It was one of the first leading industrialized nations to develop comprehensive environmental legislation and regulatory institutions. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was set up in 1970 to integrate the widely scattered programs and institutions dealing with environmental matters, instantly became a model for similar regulatory agencies that were created in other industrialized countries during the 1970s. Much of this state activity was underpinned by the world's most dynamic environmental movement, which came into existence in the mid-1960s. US environmental groups ranging from the more traditional bodies (Sierra Club, National Audubon Society) to modern environmental nongovernmental organizations (Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace) worked to create broadly based domestic support for a more ambitious environmental policy at home and abroad. US scientists and activists came to play a leading role in the global environmental movement that began to emerge in the 1970s (Kraft 2004). At the international level, the United States began to claim the mantle of environmental leader, first at the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 (Hopgood 1998:96), and later in the context of the multilateral efforts to agree on environmental treaties. Having declared eight whale species endangered based on the Endangered Species Act of 1969, the United States took up the issue of whale preservation internationally and initiated a transformation of the international whaling regime to emphasize species protection rather than natural resource usage. US diplomatic pressure and threat of sanctions were instrumental in getting the International Whaling Commission to place a ban on commercial whaling in 1984 (Porter and Brown 1996:77–81; Fletcher 2001). Also in the 1970s, the United States began to support international efforts to take action against ozone layer depletion and in the 1980s became a key advocate of international restrictions on the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. During the negotiations on the Montreal Protocol, the US government provided important leadership and exerted pressure on skeptical states, especially the European producers of ozone-depleting substances, that objected to strong international measures (Benedick 1991). Whereas the ozone negotiations provided the United States with an opportunity to display leadership in a multilateral context, US policy on the conservation of species took on a more unilateral character. More than any other country, the United States has used the threat of sanctions to change other nations' behavior in areas that endanger threatened species. Using import restrictions on products made in an environmentally damaging way, the US government forced foreign fishing fleets to comply with American standards of protection of, for example, dolphins and sea turtles (DeSombre 2001). </document> <Summary> The first use of hegemony in international environmental politics revolves around the use of superior power in the interest of international regime building.

The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour, but in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour. The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher, which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun, and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as Vega and the constellation Lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name. Mr Whipps, a 50-year-old meteorologist, said: 'I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor, which was amazing.' While the Lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour, most years the peak, which occurs tonight, only produces between five and 20 per hour (the Lyrid shower pictured from space) </document> <Summary> While sunseekers across Britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine, the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in Scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars.

"<document> This afternoon the Senate voted 68-32 to pass its sweeping immigration reform bill. The bill is a solid improvement over the current immigration system. It legalizes most of the unlawful immigrants here and provides larger pathways for legal immigration in the future. The bill does have flaws – many of which I’ve written about in detail. It doesn’t increase lawful immigration enough. The guest worker visa programs for lower skilled workers are too small, restricted to certain sectors of the economy, and governed by confusing bureaucracy. Under today’s immigration rules, very few of our ancestors would have been able to immigrate here legally. The Senate’s immigration bill takes us a small step closer to our traditionally more open immigration policy. It shovels gargantuan amounts of security resources toward the southern border in an attempt to halt future unlawful immigration that could otherwise cheaply be halted with an expanded guest worker visa program. The border “surge,” as many are calling it, is truly embarrassing, especially for a country with such proud immigrant traditions. There are certainly legitimate security concerns, but the extra enforcement will just drive up the price of smuggling and marginally decrease unlawful immigration of peaceful workers at enormous cost. </document> <Summary> This afternoon the Senate voted 68-32 to pass its sweeping immigration reform bill.

"<document> This is a beauty trend we don't see catching on. Celebrated Australian designer Akira Isogawa sent models down the runway with faces covered in sequins at his show on Wednesday morning at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. While some models were embellished with just sequinned brows, others sported an entire mask of face bling. The new beauty trend? Models at the Akira show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney on Wednesday sported a full face of sequins . The Plastics: On Wednesday's Akira models wear pink (and also plastic head pieces) 50 shades of pink: Isogawa presented a collection full of bright pinks and reds . Teams of make-up artists were pictured backstage working together to apply the sequins by hand one-by-one to models' faces. Pale pink iridescent sequins in various sizes were used to create the striking look. Just hours after Akira's show, models at Bondi Bather also showcased the sequinned beauty look. Spot the trend: Hours after Akira, models backstage at Bondi Bather were also sporting sequins on their face . Arts and crafts: The models' eye area was covered in sequins and fur balls, which also embellished their nails . Bejewelled: Imogen Anthony, who starred in the Bondi Bather show, had her entire forehead bedazzled with sequins . Backstage, the beauties posed for pictures with faces embellished with colourful sequins and beads, as well as fur balls, which also adorned their nails. AKIRA . During the Akira Isogawa show, elaborate head wear also served to accesorise the rainbow bright collection, which featured a plethora of reds and pinks, as well as intricate prints. A hydrangea print in cornflour blue also featured, alongside a purple, khaki green, blue and yellow paisley print, adding a summery, floral note to the hot, Indian pinks previously seen. Mask: Pale pink sequins in various sizes were used to create the look . It takes a village: Make-up teams worked together backstage to apply the sequins one by one . All about the brow: Some models with just sequinned brows . Oriental patterns added another line to Isogawa's runway, with olive green, red, black and white meshed in with stripes, jacquard and Chinese dragons. Couture dresses with hessian, chiffon and silk were paired with eye popping orange trenches and cream tulle headpieces. And a butter cup yellow geometric two piece also made an appearance. The ensembles were completed with models wearing red cable knit socks and the odd Adidas Infinite trainers, coordinating nicely with the model's coral lips. Hello hydrangeas: A  blue hydrangea print dress featured alongside a shawl of real hydrangea flowers at Akira . Sock it to her: Red cable knit socks and Adidas Infinite trainers were the foot wear of choice on the runway . Sway this way: Apricot and cream gowns floated and sashayed across the Akira catwalk . Rectangular runway: A model wore a butter cup yellow two piece  with fringed top and three quarter pants at Akira . Dragon slayer: Chinese dragon prints were used as corset belts in Akira's  traditional pieces . STEVEN KHALIL . Meanwhile, Steven Khalil showcased breathtaking bridal couture and stunning evening wear in his show on Wednesday at Carriageworks. The designer's elaborate wedding gowns featured full skirts with plunging necklines, and intricate embellishments. The presentation was packed with show stoppers, with sheer metallic fabrics over bodysuits and heady beading on evening gowns. Down the aisle: Steven Khalil presented a show-stopping wedding dress at his show on Wednesday . Bridal: Steven Khalil dazzled with his intricate creations . Details: Sheer metallic fabrics and heavy beading were key features amongst the evening wear . KATE SYLVESTER . Kate Sylvester showcased delicate, ladylike designs in a 'Romeo and Juliet'-inspired collection. See-through lace dresses contrasted with floral prints and understated separates. Some models walked the runway sporting shoulder armour in gold, while others wore the ;just got out of bed' trend well in slouchy striped suits. Armour: A few of the models at Kate Sylvester sported shoulder plates . Lovely in lace: Sylvester also presented see-through lace dresses in a variety of cuts and colours . Stripes in style: Laid-back wrap dresses and pyjama-style slouchy separates also featured . Inspiration: A mood board backstage instructed models to look as though 'You are madly in love, doomed to die, but you are so beautiful and so cool that you do not give a damn' A mood board backstage set the tone for models. It read: 'You are madly in love, you are doomed to die, but you are so beautiful and so cool that you do not give a damn.' JENNIFER KATE . In the afternoon, Jennifer Kate sent models down a runway strewn with white confetti. Understated leather separates in pastel hues were the focus, with cropped and crossover tops, skater skirts, and A-line skirts all featuring. Cropped leather: Jennifer Kate showed cropped leather with skater skirts in pastel hues . Luxe: Tan and grey leathers also featured, paired with stark white shoes . BONDI BATHER . It was all about cheeky swimwear for Bondi Bather, who collaborated with Hello Kitty on their new collection. Imogen Anthony acted as Creative Director for the show and also starred on the runway. Models' faces were bedazzled with sequins, while their hair was slicked back in a tight high ponytail. Hello Kitty: Bondi Bather teamed up with Hello Kitty to create bikinis and one-pieces bearing the iconic logo . Tribal influence: At Ixiah, contemporary wares were accessorised with slick hair .

Foreign policy specialists across the transatlantic community have scurried to promote ideas, such as a US promise to export gas to Europe, to reduce Russia’s leverage.¶ Some bad news for this effort is that, across much of Eastern Europe, from Bohemia to the Black Sea, Russia holds a second ace in the energy politics game: nuclear fuel.

"<document> In light of this, it is encouraging to see the new year begin with a Washington Post op-ed by Education secretary Arne Duncan on the importance of building on the reforms of No Child Left Behind to improve K–12 education in the United States. As is widely recognized, education reform represents an area in which the desire for — and substance of — reform is bipartisan. Thus, one line of reasoning is that this should be the first item of business for the new Congress, thereby establishing an ability to undertake bipartisan actions. This gets it wrong for four reasons. First, Congress has serious and pressing issues to resolve regarding the federal government’s overspending addiction and the upcoming debt limit, and those should come first. Education reform is not a dollar issue. Inflation-adjusted spending per student has roughly doubled over the past 20 years, but achievement has gone down — the problem is one of accountability. Accountability has three facets. First, it must be built upon a foundation of increased opportunity for school choice. If failure for students means failure for the teaching bureaucracy, that’s accountability. Second, it includes such state-level efforts as Florida’s, which gives grades to schools and energizes parents to demand improvements in subpar performers. Finally, it includes oversight of federal programs to ensure that the taxpayers’ dollars are used effectively. Second, while there are areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats, members need to take some time to find out what is happening on the ground before rushing to pass a reauthorization bill. This is especially true given the large influx of nearly 100 new House members and senators, all of whom will need to get up to speed on the facts in an area where urban legend often rules. For example, how did states and localities spend the stimulus funding (nearly $100 billion), “EduJobs” funding ($10 billion), and Race to the Top money they’ve gotten? Many states passed laws in the last year to improve their charter-school laws and to change the way they compensate high-performing teachers, in efforts to win Race to the Top grants. But the Race to the Top winners are only just now beginning to implement the reforms described in their applications. Are these reforms effective? Are they good models for others states? Given the importance of identifying and rewarding quality teaching (and identifying and eliminating low-quality teaching), these are questions that must be answered before taking the next steps. Third, as Congress takes steps to improve the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the top priority must be to keep students, parents, teachers, and communities first, as they are the ones on the front lines and most able to improve student achievement. This requires serious outreach, not the kind of Washington-centric, ram-it-through-before-they-catch-us mentality that has prevailed in the past two years. Finally, as members of Congress scrutinize the current law and digest the new reforms taken by states and localities, they must first and foremost ensure that their reauthorization balances the federal and local roles. The voters have made clear their distaste for federal overreach. Thus, for example, mandating that states adopt Common Core curriculum standards in order to receive funds is a step in the wrong direction. Instead, states should have the freedom to take this step on their own. At the same time, pretending that 100 percent local control would work is to de facto condemn the very students who need freedom from their failing schools. Getting this balance right will take time. </document> <Summary> As is widely recognized, education reform represents an area in which the desire for — and substance of — reform is bipartisan.

"<document> The National Security Agency and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, have worked to subvert anti-virus and other security software in order to track users and infiltrate networks, according to documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The spy agencies have reverse engineered software products, sometimes under questionable legal authority, and monitored web and email traffic in order to discreetly thwart anti-virus software and obtain intelligence from companies about security software and users of such software. One security software maker repeatedly singled out in the documents is Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, which has a holding registered in the U.K., claims more than 270,000 corporate clients, and says it protects more than 400 million people with its products. British spies aimed to thwart Kaspersky software in part through a technique known as software reverse engineering, or SRE, according to a top-secret warrant renewal request. The NSA has also studied Kaspersky Lab’s software for weaknesses, obtaining sensitive customer information by monitoring communications between the software and Kaspersky servers, according to a draft top-secret report. The U.S. spy agency also appears to have examined emails inbound to security software companies flagging new viruses and vulnerabilities. The efforts to compromise security software were of particular importance because such software is relied upon to defend against an array of digital threats and is typically more trusted by the operating system than other applications, running with elevated privileges that allow more vectors for surveillance and attack. Spy agencies seem to be engaged in a digital game of cat and mouse with anti-virus software companies; the U.S. and U.K. have aggressively probed for weaknesses in software deployed by the companies, which have themselves exposed sophisticated state-sponsored malware. Anti-virus software is an ideal target for a would-be attacker, according to Joxean Koret, a researcher with Coseinc, a Singapore-based information security consultancy. “If you write an exploit for an anti-virus product you’re likely going to get the highest privileges (root, system or even kernel) with just one shot,” Koret told The Intercept in an email. “Anti-virus products, with only a few exceptions, are years behind security-conscious client-side applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the anti-virus products out there.” According to a top-secret GCHQ warrant renewal request written in 2008 and published today by The Intercept, the British spy agency viewed Kaspersky software as an obstruction to its hacking operations and needed to reverse engineer it to find ways to neutralize the problem. Doing so required obtaining a warrant. “Personal security products such as the Russian anti-virus software Kaspersky continue to pose a challenge to GCHQ’s CNE [Computer Network Exploitation] capability and SRE is essential in order to be able to exploit such software and to prevent detection of our activities,” the warrant renewal request said. “Examination of Kaspersky and other such products continues.” The warrant renewal request also states that GCHQ reverse engineers anti-virus programs to assess their fitness for use by government agencies. The requested warrant, provided under Section 5 of the U.K.’s 1994 Intelligence Services Act, must be renewed by a government minister every six months. The document published today is a renewal request for a warrant valid from July 7, 2008 until January 7, 2009. The request seeks authorization for GCHQ activities that “involve modifying commercially available software to enable interception, decryption and other related tasks, or ‘reverse engineering’ software.” Software reverse engineering, or “reversing,” is a collection of techniques for deciphering and analyzing how a program operates. The process can be as simple as observing the flow of data into and out of the program, or as complex as analyzing the machine code — 1s and 0s — to look into the software’s inner workings, including portions of the code that are not explained in the manual or other program documentation. Put simply, it often means taking thousands of commands that instruct the computer exactly what to do and working backwards to translate them into a format that’s more intelligible to a human being. Reversing is a common, often benign practice among software developers that can be used to enable software from different companies to interoperate or to identify security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by third parties. Software makers, fearing piracy, hacking and intellectual property theft, often forbid the practice in licensing agreements and sometimes protect the most sensitive inner workings of their software with encryption. Governments have passed laws, with digital media in mind, that strictly circumscribe tampering with this encryption. Software companies have also sued to block reverse engineering as copyright infringement, arguing that it is illegal to make a copy of a program in violation of their restrictions on such copying. GCHQ felt it needed legal cover to conduct reverse engineering, writing in the warrant renewal application that the practice could otherwise be “unlawful” and amount to “a copyright infringement or breach of contract.” As we explore in a related story today, the warrant is legally questionable on several grounds, in that it applies ISA section 5 to intellectual property for the first time, and GCHQ may be applying ISA section 5 to certain categories of domestic policing. It is unclear what GCHQ accomplished in its analysis of Kaspersky software, but GCHQ has repeatedly reverse engineered software to discover vulnerabilities. Rather than report the vulnerabilities to the companies, spy agencies have quietly stockpiled numerous exploits for a wide range of commercial hardware and software, using them to hack adversaries. The NSA, like GCHQ, has studied Kaspersky Lab’s software for weaknesses. In 2008, an NSA research team discovered that Kaspersky software was transmitting sensitive user information back to the company’s servers, which could easily be intercepted and employed to track users, according to a draft of a top-secret report. The information was embedded in “User-Agent” strings included in the headers of Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, requests. Such headers are typically sent at the beginning of a web request to identify the type of software and computer issuing the request. </document> <Summary> The National Security Agency and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, have worked to subvert anti-virus and other security software in order to track users and infiltrate networks, according to documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

"<document> Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) data collection practices have eroded the public's trust in major technology companies -- and in the Internet, a Harris Interactive survey found. Harris polled over 2,000 U.S. adults for their opinions on surveillance, data gathering, Internet privacy and trust in a post-Snowden era. About 85% of those polled were at least somewhat familiar with Snowden's leaks about government surveillance and some 80% wanted Congress to implement new laws for curbing the NSA. Despite that, over half believed that mass surveillance helps prevent terrorism and an almost equal number felt that Internet companies should cooperate with the government's efforts in this regard. Somewhat paradoxically though, two out of three survey respondents also felt betrayed because ISPs and other online companies are working secretly with the government to collect and monitor the communications of private citizens. About 60% are less trusting of ISPs and other technology companies than before the revelations. The results reflect mixed emotions among Internet users said Stephen Cobb, a senior security researcher at security vendor Eset, which commissioned the Harris Interactive survey. ""People clearly are thinking more about the relationship between privacy and security. What the Snowden revelations have done is to surface the unresolved tension over this issue,"" he said. ""People would like, on the one hand, to think the surveillance is necessary. But there is push back against unnecessary surveillance."" There is little doubt that Snowden's revelations about major Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo secretly handing over customer data to intelligence agencies have shaken consumer confidence. ""The feeling of betrayal is considerable and understandable,"" Cobb said. One result is that people appear to be scaling back their Internet use. Nearly half of the respondents have become more cautious about what they say, where they go and what they do on the Internet. About 25% are less inclined to use email these days because of the same reason. Though the survey sample is relatively modest, the results are significant, Cobb said. Businesses would do well to pay attention to the results, he said. ""I don't know if banks or online retailers are noticing the same thing,"" he said. </document> <Summary> Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) data collection practices have eroded the public's trust in major technology companies -- and in the Internet, a Harris Interactive survey found.

While it continues to control funding for its many Title 22 programs, they are largely executed via DSCA and the MILDEPs. Although Congress has recognized that it has, in effect, created the basis for confusion via the two departments’ dual congressionally mandated authorities and authorizations, a political decision to create a clear lead agent for these activities remains missing.

"<document> David Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he gets broody around babies, but his wife Samantha has ruled out adding to the family in Number 10. In another joint interview on the election campaign trail, the couple were insistent that they are not planning more children, with Mrs Cameron revealing her doctor has told her: 'No way, Jose.' She was pregnant throughout the 2010 campaign, and gave birth to their fourth child Florence in Cornwall after she arrived weeks early. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has ruled out having another baby, days after she and husband David cooed over seven-week-old Regan on a visit to Chorley, Lancashire . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaign across the country . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaigned across the country. On Friday Mr Cameron celebrated his emergence from the TV leaders' debate unscathed with a visit to promote help for first time buyers. The couple cooed over seven-week-old Regan as they meet her parents, Robert Arron and Kelly Jeffers at a housing development in Chorley, Lancashire. Mr Cameron was heard quipping: 'Come on darling, maybe another one?' The Prime Minister, already a father of four, later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies. On a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant' Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Their fourth child Florence was born in the county in 2010 . David Cameron and his wife Samantha relax in Downing Street by watching Channel Four hit Gogglebox, the pair have admitted. The Prime Minister said the popular show was 'a very clever programme'. But Samantha went further, reeling off her favourite characters filmed watching television. She said she 'loved' Scarlett Moffat, the quick-witted northerner who become a cult figure over her sharp put downs caught on camera. Mrs Cameron said: 'I like the daughter in Newcastle. She's so funny, I love her, she's hilarious. I really think she's great. The Siddiquis are good as well.' After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said: 'Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody, but don't worry, nothing is going to happen on that front.' Then on a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant.' The Tory leader - who recently ruled out the couple having a fifth child - quickly interjected: 'That is not an announcement!' Now they have moved to rule out categorically any idea that they might add to their brood. Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Mrs Cameron agreed: 'We are definitely not.' She then added: 'The doctors have said 'no way, Jose'.' Mr Cameron chipped in: 'That's another story, darling… But anyway. No, we are not having any more. The last one was born not ten miles from where we are now.' Mrs Cameron gave birth to Florence in the middle of a family holiday to Cornwall in August 2010. The Prime Minister drove with his wife to hospital for what they believed would be a routine check-up. But four hours later he was by her side when she gave birth by caesarean section to their 6lb 1oz 'unbelievably beautiful girl'. It is believed Mr Cameron scrubbed up - wearing a gown and cap to reduce the chances of infection - for the delivery, which was three weeks early. The birth, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, came a year after the death of the Camerons' six-year-old son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy. The couple also have a nine-year-old son Elwen and 11-year-old daughter Nancy. </document> <Summary> David Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he gets broody around babies, but his wife Samantha has ruled out adding to the family in Number 10.

China also foreswore veto power, which the U.S. has within the IMF and World Bank, in order to persuade U.S. allies to join. With such a governance structure, China will be highly dominant within the organization – having 43% of the votes, nearly 5 times more than number 2 India (if current-dollar GDP determines voting power), as shown in the left-hand figure above. U.S. ally countries – the UK, Germany, France, and other European nations, and Australia and South Korea in the Asia-Pacific – would have only 28% of the vote.

"<document> Hillary Clinton's lead over presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has widened to 7 points nationally, according to a tracking poll released early Tuesday. Clinton leads Trump, 49 percent to 42 percent, among registered voters in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted last week. The polling was conducted as Clinton secured the number of delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and won the backing of top Democrats including President Obama. Meanwhile, Trump faced a barrage of criticism, including from top Republicans, over his comments on a federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University who he claimed was biased due to his Mexican heritage. Clinton's numbers have ticked upward in the poll since the end of May, while Trump's have inched downward, putting daylight between the two.  An increase in support among moderates, men and white voters contributed to Clinton's edge in the new poll. Clinton still gained on Trump when the poll factored in third-party candidates, too, with Clinton at 42 percent, Trump at 38 percent, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson at 9 percent and likely Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 5 percent. The survey of 10,604 adults, including 9,355 registered voters, was conducted online June 6–12. It has an overall margin of error of 1.4 percentage points. </document> <Summary> Clinton leads Trump, 49 percent to 42 percent, among registered voters in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted last week.

"<document> That lack of understanding among ordinary Americans concerns me deeply because it increases the public's suspicions and cynicism about the Congress, weakens the relationship between voters and their representatives, makes it harder for public officials to govern, and prevents our representative democracy from working the way it should. May I suggest that you have a unique responsibility and opportunity to help combat this misunderstanding of Congress because of your roles as teachers and leading analysts of the institution across the country. I believe you can improve public understanding of Congress by teaching several basic, and rather simple, lessons about this sometimes puzzling institution. My concern here is not with your understanding of the Congress. In my experience, political scientists understand the institution very well. And I know that many of you are excellent teachers who teach many of the things that I will recommend and much more. The point I want to make is that you, as much as anyone, have the power to influence the way Americans view our political system. That is not an influence you, or anyone else, should take lightly, because the way Americans look at politics shapes the capacity of our government to meet the needs of the country. If Americans leave high school and college with a solid understanding of Congress, they will be better able to contribute to our nation's political life and will help make our representative democracy work better. </document> <Summary> Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month.
The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February.

According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'.
Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu.

"<document> U.S. President Donald Trump, declaring a national emergency because of tensions with Iran, swept aside objections from Congress on Friday to complete the sale of over $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. The Trump administration informed congressional committees that it will go ahead with 22 military sales to the Saudis, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, infuriating lawmakers by circumventing a long-standing precedent for congressional review of major weapons sales. Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for months, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Lawmakers and congressional aides warned earlier this week that Trump, frustrated with Congress holding up weapons deals including the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia, was considering using a loophole in arms control law to go ahead by declaring a national emergency. “President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove ... There is no new ‘emergency’ reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there,” said Senator Chris Murphy. Murphy, a Democrat, made public on Twitter on Wednesday that Trump was considering the loophole in the Arms Control Export Act to clear the sales. Several of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, said they would object to such a plan, fearing that blowing through the “holds” process would eliminate Congress’ ability to check not just Trump but future presidents from selling weapons where they liked. Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said the administration’s action was “unfortunate” and likely to damage future White House interactions with Congress. “I would have strongly preferred for the administration to utilize the long-established and codified arms sale review process,” McCaul said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that U.S. partners in the Middle East needed the contracts to be completed to help deter Iran, and that the decision to circumvent Congress was meant to be a “one-time event.” It is not the first time Congress and Trump have clashed over policy in the region, or the division of powers between the White House and Capitol Hill. The House and Senate voted to end U.S. military support for the campaign in Yemen earlier this year, but Trump vetoed the resolution. BOON TO DEFENSE INDUSTRYIn documents sent to Congress, Pompeo listed a wide range of products and services that would be provided to the countries. They include Raytheon precision-guided munitions (PGMs), support for Boeing Co F-15 aircraft, and Javelin anti-tank missiles, which are made by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp. Other companies that will benefit include General Electric, now cleared to sell engines for use in F-16 fighter jets operated by the UAE and the U.S. unit of French firm Thales, which was cleared to sell a fuzing system for Paveway IV precision guided bombs to Britain and the UAE. It will also likely be welcome news for Britain’s BAE Systems Plc and Europe’s Airbus, clearing the way for installation of Paveway laser-guided bombs on European-built Eurofighter and Tornado fighter jets sold to Saudi Arabia, as well F-15 fighters built by Boeing. “I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump Administration has failed once again to prioritize our long-term national security interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favors to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia,” Senator Bob Menendez said in a statement. Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, vowed to fight the action, and said he was in talks with both Democrats and some of Trump’s fellow Republicans on ways to preserve congressional review of arms sales. The Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Republican Senator Jim Risch, said he had received formal notification of the administration’s intent to move forward. In a statement, Risch said, “I am reviewing and analyzing the legal justification for this action and the associated implications.” In his memorandum justifying the emergency declaration, Pompeo listed years of actions by Iran. “Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at home and abroad,” he wrote, and cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Tehran. Trump’s administration also announced that it was sending 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East, which it described as an effort to bolster defenses against Iran against what it sees as a threat of potential attack. Members of Congress from both parties have worried that Trump is pushing toward war with Iran. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, said the administration was responding to important needs from partners. </document> <Summary> U.S. President Donald Trump, declaring a national emergency because of tensions with Iran, swept aside objections from Congress on Friday to complete the sale of over $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. 
The Trump administration informed congressional committees that it will go ahead with 22 military sales to the Saudis, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, infuriating lawmakers by circumventing a long-standing precedent for congressional review of major weapons sales. 
Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for months, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. 
Lawmakers and congressional aides warned earlier this week that Trump, frustrated with Congress holding up weapons deals including the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia, was considering using a loophole in arms control law to go ahead by declaring a national emergency. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that U.S. partners in the Middle East needed the contracts to be completed to help deter Iran, and that the decision to circumvent Congress was meant to be a “one-time event.” 
In documents sent to Congress, Pompeo listed a wide range of products and services that would be provided to the countries. They include Raytheon precision-guided munitions (PGMs), support for Boeing Co F-15 aircraft, and Javelin anti-tank missiles, which are made by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp. 
“I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump Administration has failed once again to prioritize our long-term national security interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favors to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia,” Senator Bob Menendez said in a statement. </Summary>"
"<document> The baggage handler who caused an emergency landing when he woke up inside the cargo hold of an airborne flight has come forward for the first time to detail the frightening experience, but still won't explain how he fell asleep to begin with. Willa Junior sat down with ABC News for an interview, and says he was exhausted and dozed off while loading a plane at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on April 13 and woke up when a piece of luggage landed on his head. The airport worker, who appears to be in his early 20s according to Facebook, wouldn't explain how he had the time to take a nap on the plane but says it used to be common practice: 'I mean when I first started the job, we took naps.' Scroll down for video . Taking responsibility: Willa Junior is the Seattle-Tacoma baggage handler who fell asleep in the cargo hold of a plane earlier this month, and became trapped inside when the plane took off . Making headlines: Junior, who appears to be in his early 20s according to Facebook, sat down for an interview with ABC News to speak about the harrowing and embarrassing experience . Nap time: Junior says he was exhausted when he dosed off while loading an Alaska Airlines flight on April 13. Above, a picture of Junior being rescued from the cargo hold after the plane was forced to turn around . Rude awakening: Junior woke up when a piece of luggage landed on him and then he called 911 - but his call cut out after just 44 seconds . Since it was pitch black inside the cargo hold, Junior was at first confused and disoriented but then quickly realized that the plane was moving. 'In my mind, I said, ""This is not happening. This is just a joke.""' Junior . His first move was to call his company, Menzies Aviation, which provides baggage services for airlines. But the person who answered the call at the office thought it was a prank call and just hung up. Desperately, Junior next called 911 and struggled to communicate to the dispatcher his unusual and unlikely situation. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane,' Junior tells the operator in audio released of the 911 call. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane.I feel like it's moving in the air. Flight 448. Can you please sent someone to stop it?' Junior says. Unfortunately the phone call cut out after 44 seconds and then Junior was on his own. That's when he started to lose hope, sending a text message to his mother saying he loved her, afraid he was going to die. Last words: Junior says he was scared he was going to die, so he sent a text message to his mother, saying he loved her. The area Junior was trapped in was pressurized and temperature controlled, so his life was never threatened . Help me! After his call to 911 cut out, Junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and passengers and crew heard, prompting the flight to turn around . Turn around: The pilot headed back to Seattle after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior says he is sorry for the passengers whose flight to Los Angeles he delayed . Luckily that was never the case since the cargo hold where Junior fell asleep is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was never in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. What saved Junior from being trapped on the flight for it's two and a half hour journey to Los Angeles was his decision to start banging on the roof of the cargo floor. 'I was yelling, ""Help me, somebody’s down here,""' he said. Junior's cries for help were so loud that passengers and crew members heard and the plane was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior is currently still employed at Menzies, but he has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines flights - one of the biggest airlines that fly our of Sea-Tac Airport.

Manchester City's David Silva and Everton's Phil Jagielka were also among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods. This comes amid mounting concern that celebrities and sports stars are cashing in by turning Twitter into an advertising platform. The players posted messages within minutes of each other yesterday, with Arsenal forward Walcott tweeting: 'For 25 hours you can get 25% discount on Adidas.co.uk if you use 'friendsoftheo'.' Premier League stars including Arsenal forward Theo Walcott (pictured) could face an advertising watchdog probe they plugged an Adidas sale on Twitter . Silva tweeted: 'Who is up for 25% savings on @adidas products? Click here to find out more! #friendsofdavid.' Guidance from the Advertising Standards Authority states that when there is payment and control from an advertiser, the sponsored tweet should be obviously identifiable. British celebrities have been advised to include the word 'ad' or 'spon' to show if something is an advert or sponsored. The watchdog has previously banned a Nike campaign featuring tweets from Wayne Rooney, one of its brand ambassadors, because they were not clearly identified as promotional messages. Players including Steven Gerrard (pictured) and Everton's Phil Jagielka were  among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods . It was the first UK company to have a Twitter campaign banned, after the ASA ruled in 2012 that the use of the  personal accounts of footballers broke the rules. The Manchester United striker, who has more than 11 million followers, tweeted: 'My resolution — to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion...#makeitcount gonike.me/makeitcount'. A tweet from Jack Wilshere said: 'In 2012, I will come back for my club — and be ready for my country.#makeitcount.gonike.me/Makeitcount'. Both footballers were banned from repeating the messages and Nike was warned about ensuring all Twitter advertising is easily identifiable. England footballer Phil Jones and Manchester City's David Silva posted messages within minutes of each other . But another one of Rooney's tweets was said to have not breached advertising rules because its language was markedly different from the footballer's usual Twitter messages. This tweet said: 'The pitches change. The killer instinct doesn't. Own the turf, anywhere. @NikeFootball #myground.' The Advertising Standards Authority has not yet received any complaints about the promotional tweets for Adidas. But a spokesman said: 'If we receive complaints that tweets have broken rules, we will investigate. 'Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such. 'If any social media account (including celebrity twitter accounts) are tweeting ads and it's not clear from the context that these are marketing communications then they need to be labelled as an ad.' Some fans saw straight through the players' Adidas tweets, with GX Blue ‏tweeting: 'I bet you David Silva didn't write that tweet himself!!' A spokesman for Adidas said: 'To our knowledge, there have not been any complaints about the tweets and we have not been contacted by the ASA with regards to this matter.

"<document> Andy Hornby is non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U, which was found to be selling NHS patients' details on without their knowledge . The chairman of the online pharmacy site found to be selling NHS patients’ data without their knowledge is the shamed former chief executive of HBOS. A Mail investigation yesterday told how the personal details of thousands of users of Pharmacy 2U are being sold to companies that target the sick. Now we can reveal that at its helm is the disgraced banker Andy Hornby, who was in charge of HBOS when it collapsed in 2008. Mr Hornby last night faced calls to step down from his role as non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U and was condemned for profiting from the sale of his customers’ personal data. Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled. Others who use the NHS-approved pharmacy website used its online doctor consultations. Their details – which included email addresses and dates of birth – were passed on without proper consent. When Mr Hornby joined the company, the UK’s leading online pharmacy, in 2012, it said in a statement: ‘The imminent transition to electronic prescriptions across the NHS represents an exciting opportunity for Pharmacy 2U, and Andy’s insights and leadership will be of significant value.’ It is not known how much Mr Hornby – who works two to three days a week – is earning from the Leeds-based company, but it is thought he received a significant salary increase last year. He is also a principle shareholder. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, last night called for Mr Hornby to step down and for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy 2U. She said: ‘He should be called to account for what his company is doing and issue a public statement. He needs to be made to sit down and explain why patient information is being sold on.’ She added that the health select committee should launch an inquiry into the issue after the election. Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, sold details including the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to marketing firms . Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled . Following the financial crash in the autumn of 2008, a devastating report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accused Mr Hornby and fellow former bosses of ‘catastrophic failures’ as they presided over years of reckless lending. His current role is his third job since then. In 2011 he unexpectedly quit as £1million-a-year chief executive of healthcare group Alliance Boots, a move blamed on stress. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, called for Mr Hornby to step down . Four months later he became boss of Coral, a position he still holds. In 2013, he faced calls to quit amid reports the bookmaker was set for a £2billion flotation. Pharmacy 2U admitted that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘up to 5,000’ patients to data company Alchemy Direct but refused to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information to Alchemy and stressed no medical data had been passed on. Last night Pharmacy 2U said that Mr Hornby is ‘not involved in day-to-day decisions about the running of the business’. A spokesman added: ‘We have asked the Information Commissioner’s Office to work with us to review our privacy policy and have also contacted the General Pharmaceutical Council, our industry regulator, and the NHS, to discuss this matter.’ NHS England said: ‘Any breach of confidentiality is totally unacceptable. This case will be reported to the Information Commissioner and General Pharmaceutical Council and there will be an immediate investigation.’ </document> <Summary> The chairman of the online pharmacy site found to be selling NHS patients’ data without their knowledge is the shamed former chief executive of HBOS, Andy Hornby.

"<document> It is worth pausing to consider the potential net-widening or punishment-enhancing effect of informed misdemeanor sentencing. Net-widening, as well as class and race biases, are continuing critiques of the problem-solving court movement. 168 Net-widening occurs when law enforcement and prosecutors bring more individuals into the criminal justice system on the belief that the system can help them; net-widening also occurs when individuals who would otherwise be in the system but would suffer minimal punishment in a traditional courtroom are brought [*208] into a treatment court that imposes more onerous conditions before termination of the sentence (this has also been seen as punishment-enhancing). 169 There is a danger that informed misdemeanor sentencing can lead to net widening or punishment-enhancing simply because the judge has more information under such an approach than under current approaches to misdemeanor sentencing. </document> <Summary> It's worth considering the potential for net-widening or punishment-enhancing effects with informed misdemeanor sentencing.
Net-widening and biases are critiques of problem-solving courts, occurring when more individuals are brought into the system or treated more harshly.

"<document> With the fourth anniversary of the executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia fast approaching, we must continue to challenge the notion of “an eye for an eye”. Here are five reasons why. 1. You can’t take it back The death penalty is irreversible. Absolute judgments may lead to people paying for crimes they did not commit. Texas man Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly setting a fire that killed his three daughters. Following his execution, further evidence revealed that Willingham did not set the fire that caused their deaths. But it came too late. A mug shot of Cameron Todd Willingham. There are two photo side-by-side. One shows Willingham looking towards the camera, the other shows Willingham's side profile. Cameron Todd Willingham © Peter K. Levy / Flickr 2. It doesn’t deter criminals There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term. In, evidence reveals the opposite. Since abolishing the death penalty in 1976, Canada’s murder rate has steadily declined and as of 2016 was at its lowest since 1966. 3. There’s no ‘humane’ way to kill fact The 2006 execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, by a so-called ‘humane’ lethal injection, took 34 minutes and required two doses. Doctors have said that it is likely Diaz’ death was painful. Other brutal methods of execution used around the world include hanging, shooting and beheading. The nature of these deaths only continues to perpetuate the cycle of violence and may not alleviate the pain already suffered by the victims’ family. 4. It makes a public spectacle of an individual’s death Executions are often undertaken in an extremely public manner, with public hangings in Iran or live broadcasts of lethal injections in the US. According to UN human rights experts, executions in public serve no legitimate purpose and only increase the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of this punishment. “All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. “All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated.” HASSIBA HADJ SAHRAOUI 5. The death penalty is disappearing In 2017 two countries – Guinea and Mongolia – abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Today, 106 countries (the majority of the world’s states) have turned their backs on the death penalty for good. Those that continue to execute are a tiny minority standing against a wave of opposition. There are countless arguments for and against the death penalty. </document> <Summary> The death penalty is irreversible, leading to people paying for crimes they did not commit, as in the case of Texas man Cameron Todd Willingham who was executed in 2004 for allegedly setting a fire that killed his three daughters, but further evidence revealed that he did not set the fire.
 
There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term, as evidenced by Canada's steadily declining murder rate since abolishing the death penalty in 1976.
 
The 2006 execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, by a so-called ‘humane’ lethal injection, took 34 minutes and required two doses, indicating that there's no ‘humane’ way to kill.
 
Executions are often undertaken in an extremely public manner, with public hangings in Iran or live broadcasts of lethal injections in the US, which according to UN human rights experts, serve no legitimate purpose and only increase the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of this punishment.

It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard’s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager’s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season’s standout player for £32million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out . Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house . Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille . That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote .

"<document> As far back as the early 1990s, Washington thought trade and investment eventually would make China more democratic. In the past couple of years, though, the Communist Party has doubled down on repression at home and become more aggressive overseas. In short, things have not turned out as Washington had hoped, and relations between the world's two major powers are tense these days. President Obama will continue to work on that tricky relationship after he arrives in Beijing on Monday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The gathering provides Chinese President Xi Jinping with an international platform as he hosts leaders from Japan, India and Russia and tries to boost China's standing in world affairs. Prosperity's Unexpected Consequences Two decades ago, Republicans, Democrats and some prominent China scholars argued that economic engagement would change China's political system over time. ""By working with China and expanding areas of cooperation, dealing forthrightly with our differences, we can advance fundamental American interests and values,"" President Bill Clinton said in 1997. James Mann, author of The China Fantasy: Why Capitalism Will Not Bring Democracy to China, says the conventional wisdom was China's authoritarian system naturally would evolve. ""Part of the theory was, it was just inevitable,"" says Mann, a scholar-in-residence at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""Any country that became prosperous and had growing trade and investment ties with the world would automatically liberalize."" One popular U.S. columnist argued that as Chinese enjoyed greater and greater consumer choices — such as various types of coffee at Starbucks — a desire for political choice would follow. After meeting with then-premier Wen Jiabao in 2005, then-U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters China was heading towards a more open political system. ""The whole basis of the discussion I have had in a country that is developing very fast — where 100 million people now use the Internet, and which is going to be the second-largest economy in the world — is that there is an unstoppable momentum toward greater political freedom,"" Blair told reporters in Beijing, according to Bloomberg News. But Mann says capitalism had the opposite effect. ""It resulted in a rich, authoritarian regime, which is not what we were looking for in the first place, and which is more of a problem to deal with,"" he says. China has poured some of its riches into naval power and is now tangling with Japan and the Philippines, close American allies, over disputed islands. China claims most of the vast South China Sea as its own, despite the protests of various neighbors. Mann says American policymakers thought China would follow the path of other East Asian dictatorships, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which democratized in the 1980s. Those countries, however, relied on the U.S. for their defense, which Washington used as political leverage. ""The United States pushed Taiwan over a decade,"" says Mann. ""None of that is going to happen in China. It has an entirely different relationship with the United States."" Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, says that instead of democratizing China, economic growth helped the party strengthen its grip on power. ""The U.S. has gravely underestimated the capabilities, the determination, the resourcefulness of the Chinese Communist Party. Better economic performance gives them greater political legitimacy, and [then] they don't have to do political reform,"" says Pei. It also ""allows them more resources to use repression to defend one-party rule."" Since coming to power in 2012, President Xi has cracked down on Internet speech and jailed all sorts of critics. Last month, an 81-year-old writer known by the pen name Tie Liu was charged with ""creating a disturbance."" Among his apparent offenses: publishing the accounts of some of the political victims of Mao Zedong, who died in 1976. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, knows China's political failings, but says the party has made improvements for which it doesn't receive credit. Those include term limits for top leaders, who — though not popularly elected — pay close attention to public opinion. ""America somehow is impatient,"" says Shen, who says Americans seem to think the only form of democracy is the one-person, one-vote Western model. America ""is too idealistic and is too chauvinistic."" Trends That Undermine Communist Power How long can the Communist Party stay in power? Pei expects it to run out of gas in 10 to 15 years. ""The people who work for this system have no fundamental loyalty to the system,"" says Pei. Indeed, the conventional wisdom among Chinese themselves is that most people who have joined the party in the past decade primarily did so to enrich themselves through connections and graft. ""All they want to do is benefit personally from their relationship with the system,"" Pei continues. ""So, over the long run, the system will go bankrupt."" </document> <Summary> As far back as the early 1990s, Washington thought trade and investment eventually would make China more democratic.

The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game.

Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale’s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti. He said in midweek: ‘Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team. The Croatian injured himself towards the end of last year and when he missed three months of football it coincided with the team’s worst run of form.

Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of Shaun Derry on March 23, with Paul Hart and Mick Halsall taking caretaker charge of their recent games. But Moniz, who steered Red Bull Salzburg to Austrian league and cup glory in the 2011/12 campaign, will now take the reins.

The League One club have confirmed that Dave Kevan will be Moniz's assistant at Meadow Lane . Magpies chairman Ray Trew told the club's official website: 'As I have said previously, I set out on our search for a new manager with an open mind but with a determination to find someone who would be able to bring a new level of excitement to Notts County. 'I think in Ricardo we have found that because, having spoken to him at length, his footballing philosophy is one of structured attacking play, which I hope is something that our fans will buy into, because I know that when I come to Meadow Lane I want to be entertained, I want to be excited by what I see out there on the pitch. 'Results, of course, are the yardstick by which managers are ultimately judged, but if we can play the sort of football that gets people off their seats and instil in our players the desire to take games to our opponents, I think we can make a real impression in this division.

'Ricardo has a fantastic reputation within the game, not only for the style of football that he plays, but also his ability to spot and nurture young talent, so I am confident that his appointment will be of benefit to all levels of the club. 'In Dave I have been able to bring in someone who knows this level of football and, perhaps equally importantly, knows this football club. He's a Notts County person and I am delighted that he agreed to return for what I feel is an exciting period ahead for the club.

"<document> The term “homophobia” was first coined by G Weinberg (1972) to mean “the irrational condemnation of homosexual individuals, which results in violence, deprivation, and separation”. For some the term is not adequate to express the extent of the oppression of people on account of their sexual identity. In psychology phobia denotes fear, usually irrational. Some feel what is called homophobia is much more than just an irrational fear. It is a prejudice which often leads to acts of discrimination, abuse and violence. Homo which means “the same” places the emphasis on the oppressed rather than on the oppressors. Alternative terms presented are: gay and/or lesbian hatred or hating, sexual orientationalism (along with racism, sexism, etc) and heterosexism, “defined as both the belief that heterosexuality is or should be the only acceptable sexual orientation and the fear and hatred of those who love and sexually desire those of the same sex” (Blumenfeld 1992:15). Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment and violence. It is driven by fear and hatred. The term heterosexism includes both the cultural precedence of heterosexuality and what is commonly referred to as homophobia. Some prefer to retain the term homophobia since it has become entrenched and is widely used by all groups and also by the media. Blumenfeld (1992:18) summarises it as follows: [W]e are all born into a great pollution called homophobia (one among many forms of oppression), which falls on us like acid rain. For some people spirits are tarnished to the core, others are marred on the surface, and no one is completely protected. But neither are we to blame. We had no control over the formulation of this Hegemony and the internalisation of homophobia 6 HTS 63(1) 2007 pollution, nor did we direct it to pour down on us. On the other hand, we all have a responsibility, indeed an opportunity, to join together to construct shelter from the corrosive effect of oppression while working to clean up the homophobic environment in which we live. Once sufficient steps are taken to reduce this pollution, we will all breathe a lot easier. Since the seventies “homophobia”, denoting negative attitudes towards homosexual people, has become a more general term (see Gough 2002:219). Audrey Lorde (1988:321) defines homophobia as “a terror surrounding feelings of love for members of the same sex and thereby a hatred of those feelings in others” and heterosexism as “a belief in the inherent superiority of one form of loving over all others and thereby the right to dominance”. Together they mirror a culture of “heteronormativity”, which, according to Oesterreich (2002:288; cf Blumenfeld 1992), is “the idea that society and political economy presuppose the consistent pairing of women and men … Consequently, heteronormativity inherently limits who is counted as a citizen and the ways in which a citizen can participate in democratic citizenship.” Gender is construed by society to be a matter of “either/or”: one is either male or female. There is nothing in between. Gender norm deviations are punished by social means such as stereotyping and labelling (see Thorne 1995; Wong et al 1999; West & Zimmerman 1987). In order to make the label stick, traits which emphasize their “abnormality” are exaggerated – gay men as effeminate and gay women as “butch”. Homophobia is the consequence of this, embedded in a society that tends to conceptualise gender in a binary way (see Bem 1993; Gagne, Tewksbury & McGaughey 1997:478-508; Ingraham 1994:203-219; Wong et al 1999:19-31). </document> <Summary> The term “homophobia” was first coined by G Weinberg (1972) to mean “the irrational condemnation of homosexual individuals, which results in violence, deprivation, and separation”.

"<document> Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel. The former child star turned Real Housewife discusses her demons in an emotional interview with Dr. Phil set to air April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest. Among the topics the 50-year-old is slated to discuss is her longtime struggle with alcoholism. About her April 16 arrest, Richards reveals, 'I was angry and frightened and I was scared. I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn’t drink.' Richards - who has been to rehab three times - was charged with with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting arrest and battery on a police officer and arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel last week. Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty. While Kim Richards staunchly defended herself during the last season of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills - maintaining that she no longer struggles with substance abuse - reports from the cast and crew tell a different story. Several sources involved in production told TMZ that Kim's recent protestations that she was sober were laughable. And while veteran cast members Kyle Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Yolanda Foster learned to look the other way to avoid drama, Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson were the ones to confront the star. Insiders say that the 50-year-old would never drink where people could see her, sometimes drinking in the bathroom and emerging drunk. However, other sources from the show say that Kim was doing a better job than ever of keeping her addiction under control. Interestingly, Brandi Glanville - who was one of Kim's closest friends during season five - sided with both camps, depending on who you talked to. They knew better: Veteran cast members such as Kim's sister Kyle, Yolanda Foster and Lisa Vanderpump all chose to look away during the last season to avoid confrontation . Speaking out: Eileen Davidson (third left) and Lisa Rinna (second from right) were the two who chose to confront Kim about her issues during season five . One crew member revealed that Kim's sobriety was called into question several months ago after the incident where the mother-of-four's dog bit her sister Kyle's daughter Alexia. When a dog trainer was sent to her house to assess the situation Kim was reportedly such a mess he had to help put her to bed. Kim was arrested on Thursday morning after a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel where she had to be dragged out of a bathroom after refusing to leave the premises. She was taken to jail and cited with trespass, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and drunk in public. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the former child star may be booted off the Bravo show as producers feel she has become a liability due to her issues with substance abuse. Playing both sides: Insiders say that Brandi Glanville (centre) - who was one of Kim's closest plas during the last season - sides with both camps . Confirmed: Details of Kim's arrest were revealed in a statement from the Beverly Hills police department . Since she first appeared on the hit reality show in 2010, her sobriety has been her major storyline, with her recent relapse as the driving force between Kim and Kyle's distant relationship. TMZ alleges that Bravo are concerned that due to the nature of the show, they could be held accountable if something was to happen to Kim. There have been no permanent decisions made however, according to the gossip site. The next season of RHOBH has a few months before production picks up again so the final decision has yet to be concrete. Distressed: The mother-of-four reportedly started drinking after watching all three RHOBH reunion shows on Wednesday night . </document> <Summary> Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel.

"<document> Amazing pictures have emerged of  blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

"<document> Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame MI5 and the police for radicalising British teenagers who then flee the country to join ISIS. A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS. The figures show that among young and female Muslims, one third have sympathy for the Jihadi runaways despite the deplorable images of ISIS atrocities posted on the internet. Eight per cent agreed they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame the security services for radicalising young Jihadis . Eight per cent of British Muslims said they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John, pictured . Six out of ten strongly condemned those, such as Jihadi John, who have joined ISIS. The survey conducted by Survation on behalf of Sky News found that one-third of all Muslims felt they are viewed with suspicion by non-Muslims. It follows a similar poll earlier this year that found more than a quarter of Muslims sympathised with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who brutally murdered journalists at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. Yesterday's Survation study of 1,001 non-Muslims, 44 per cent agreed they were more suspicious of Muslims than they had been previously. The pollsters asked Muslims and non-Muslims about whether they felt Islam was 'compatible' with British values and the British way of life. According to the survey, three quarters of Muslims agreed their religion was compatible with the values of British society, with 14 per cent disagreeing. For non-Muslims, less than one quarter viewed Islam as compatible with British values with around half saying the religion was incompatible. One in five followers of Islam believe that British Muslims do not do enough to integrate into society, while 64 per cent believe they do, the pollsters found. Another six per cent felt it was not important for Muslims to fit into British society. Their families: 44% . Government: 15.1% . Religious authorities: 8.8% . Police: 3% . Schools: 2.2% . No-one: 4.6% . Other: 22.1% . 1,001 Muslims polled by Survation for Sky News . The researchers found that one in seven non-Muslims had sympathy for those who have joined ISIS. The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of Muslims agreed that the security services were partly responsible for radicalising young Jihadis, compared with 16 per cent of non-Muslims. Meanwhile more than half of the Muslims surveyed said it was their responsibility to condemn terrorist attacks by Muslims in the name of Islam, while a third said it was not. When it comes to stopping young Muslims joining terrorist groups, 44 per cent felt it was the responsibility of their families to set them straight. More than 15 per cent said it was the government's responsibility, followed by religious authorities (nine per cent), the police (three per cent) and schools (two per cent). The father of one of the three east London schoolgirls who fled to Syria to become 'jihadi brides' blamed the police for failing to keep track of them. Abase Hussen (circled) blamed the police and schools for allowing his daughter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, only for footage to emerge of him at an extremist rally in central London . More than a quarter of Muslims polled in a previous survey said they had sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attackers . Abase Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued a grovelling apology to the family, only for footage to emerge showing Mr Hussen at an extremist rally in central London. He could be seen standing just feet from one of Lee Rigby's killers while yelling: 'Burn, burn USA.' The survey comes two months after a separate poll found that more than quarter of Muslims said they had sympathy for Charlie Hebdo attackers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who killed 12 on their rampage around Paris. That poll, commissioned by the BBC, also found that 32 per cent of Muslims were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. The Muslim Council of Britain told the Daily Telegraph: 'For many, current counter-terrorism measures, particularly related to the Prevent strategy, actually lead to greater alienation as Muslims are seen through the lens of security, rather than tackling the scourge of terrorism itself.' The Council said it was pleased that the survey 'once again confirms that Muslims feel British and have a strong affinity with our shared universal values'. </document> <Summary> A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS.

And remember that activity up to next one 712 but called out by councilmembers Ortega and shepherd and I just I'll start with Ortega did you want to call this out or do Councilwoman Shepherd did you want to call it out or did
Speaker 3: you have a question? Questions. Question. Councilwoman Taylor? GRENELL.
Speaker 8: My question is for someone from Public Works. Your final Q. So this bill deals with traffic signals. And what I'm wondering is if it involves removing any traffic signals from locations, because I know in a number of our neighborhoods where we have had lights, they've been removed and replaced with stop signs.
Speaker 8: So is this just for new lights or is it also for removing traffic signal lights in some areas?
Speaker 2: Okay. I'm Michael Pennacchio with Denver Public Works Transportation. This particular grant is for upgrading existing traffic signals, so it's going to upgrade the communications and the backup battery power to the existing traffic signals.
Speaker 8: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Ortega, Councilwoman Shepherd.
Speaker 1: So to go a little bit further with that, I am wondering, does it include any kind of upgrades that might have like pedestrian countdown signals associated with them?
Speaker 2: This again, this grant is more for aimed at communications and battery backup. So most of the equipment that we'll be replacing isn't seen by the general public. It's it's the way that the signal is going to operates, the way that we maintain and operate in.
Speaker 1: You mean how the brain, like the central brain communicates to these?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the computer that controls it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then how how are the. So are you saying that that the brain is getting updated or the individual signals the brain is being updated or the individual signals?
Speaker 2: It's it's the way that it communicates to our central system.
Speaker 1: The individual ones. So how are those chosen? Well, how do you choose which ones to upgrade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have a well, we have the list of all of them that we take to. This is a grant that we apply for. And we received four years worth of grant money to upgrade regionally significant signals. So typically we'll see these programs along like Federal Boulevard along shared in a lot of state facilities, ones that reach
Speaker 2: outside of the extent of Denver.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Shephard. Any other questions on 712? All right. And thank you, Mr. Flynn. Okay. And that's 1786 called out by Councilman Monteiro. What would you like for us to do with this?

Speaker 0: Coming in. Okay, great. I see Ms.. TOS name on the screen and now I see her in person. Welcome. Hi.
Speaker 4: Thank you. Good. Good evening.
Speaker 1: Mayor. And some members of the City Council. My name is Anita.
Speaker 4: I'm here to present this item for you tonight. With me tonight is also.
Speaker 1: Up on council.
Speaker 4: Ryan Quinn, as well as members from.
Speaker 1: Wells Fargo team who are here to answer any questions you may have. Just a little bit of background in April of 2016. Union Bank was hired by the city to.
Speaker 4: Provide a letter of credit for the Alameda Public Financing Authority Variable Rate Demand Bonds known as Alameda Point Improvement Project.
Speaker 1: For $9,080,000.23 Series A and 4,000,003 360,000.
Speaker 4: For the 2003 Series.
Speaker 1: B bonds for the taxable taxable bonds.
Speaker 4: As background, Alameda Public Financing Authority issued a total of approximately 12.4 million and variable rate bonds.
Speaker 1: Related to allow me to point in 2003, the source of repayment for these bonds as a rental income received from properties managed by the city's Base Reuse Department. Union Bank expired in.
Speaker 4: The LLC, with Union.
Speaker 1: Bank expire in June 14 of 2021. Fortunately, the city was able to receive an extension until November 15, 2021. With that extension, however, Union Bank increased the fee from 115 basis point to 125 basis points.
Speaker 4: Plus they charge a one time fee of 5000 for the one time extension.
Speaker 1: Union Bank has told us that they will not extend the LLC beyond the November 2021 expiration date. The market for the city's LLC is very limited because of the small size of the outstanding bonds. Typically, banks prefer large deals so they can.
Speaker 4: Fine spread the cost of the.
Speaker 1: Transaction over the size of the bonds. So the city reach out to other banks about providing a.
Speaker 4: Letter of credit only.
Speaker 1: To banks to express interest.
Speaker 4: U.S. Bank in Wells Fargo.
Speaker 1: Wells Fargo stepped.
Speaker 4: Up and submitted a term sheet which offer a three year.
Speaker 1: LLC at 100 basis points to the city. So is my.
Speaker 4: Recommendation that we proceed with the substitution of the letter of credit. A bond counsel, Brian Quinn, is here to answer.
Speaker 1: Any questions that you may have. Thank you very much.
Speaker 0: Thank you for that clear and concise report. Ms.. TA And Madam Clerk, I meant to ask, do we have public speakers on this item?
Speaker 1: We do not.
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'll close public comment. So then, counsel, I will open the floor to counsel for any clarifying questions for a motion. What's your pleasure? By my count, from every next flight.
Speaker 3: I'd be happy to move approval of the staff provider resolutions.
Speaker 0: All right, Councilmember Spencer. All right. Any further council discussion? All right. We really appreciate all you representatives of Wells Fargo, Aspen Council for being here. Welcome. We'll get you home early tonight. Okay. So seeing no discussion. Madam, may we have a roll call vote, please.

"<document> Speaker 7: The Report of the Public Safety, Civil Rights and Technology Committee. Agenda item number one, resolution 31578. Reaffirming the City of Seattle support of Somali communities to continue remittances to Somalia and the Horn of Africa. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell. Thank you very much, council president. So this resolution is addressing a very serious concern in the Somali community, in the Horn of Africa community, relative to the remittance policy. I think many of you are following the issue that when the Merchants Bank of California closed down the accounts of all Somali-American money transfer operations
Speaker 0: in 2015. This has been devastating to the community, Somali community, trying to send money down to their families. And you've seen in the last several years of this cracking down, if you will, and it has devastated many communities and in particular, our local community as well.
Speaker 0: And so this is an attempt to address the seriousness of the issue and to really think about how the city can work with the Somali community to come up with policies, processes, advocacy strategies, solutions that will help the Somali community address this and also, in that process address many of the issues, such as access to capital and
Speaker 0: access to credit as well that would help local communities. So again, I want to thank the executive for reaching out and convening several meetings and I think council members so want a Liccardo O'Brien and others for being deeply involved in the community, trying to work with community members, help us move forward, finding solutions.
Speaker 0: So this resolution states our commitments and I look forward to the ongoing work as we address to Somali remains issue should pass out of committee with full vote and I ask for your support and are you going to move a substitute and I am going to do something that the clerk asked me to do, which is I
Speaker 0: move to amend Resolution 31578 by substituting version for perversion three. And as I move that, there was just some semantic, some semantic issues raised by the law department, but I don't think a change of substance at all. Also I'll second the motion.
Speaker 0: It's been moved that we substitute version four for version three. Are there any questions or discussion on the substitution? All in favor of approving the motion vote. I oppose vote no. So we now have version four in front of us.
Speaker 0: Any questions or comments? Councilmember Swan.
Speaker 5: Thank you. President Burgess Just to add to the comments by Councilmember Harrell, this is a very important resolution. While the City Council does not have any legal jurisdiction over the banks that we are talking about. It does help to put pressure on the federal government, which is, you know, this this the the language of the resolution is
Speaker 5: really geared towards that. And I want to mention that we following Minneapolis as a city that also has passed a similar resolution, I thanked Eisenberg for bringing this forward and for also for being open to the amendments to be brought forward on the suggestion of community activists.
Speaker 5: And above all, thanks to the community activists, we have two of them here, the Abdullah and Hassan, these thank you for your involvement. And clearly, of course, we have a lot of work to do for the welfare of the community, but this was definitely a big part of that.

"<document> Critiques of the CRC come in three general forms. First, some simply call the CRC ineffective because it has no enforcement teeth. They claim the CRC is simply ineffective to stop the world’s most horrifying abuses of children, such as child trafficking for sexual exploitation, compulsory child labor, child soldiering and forcible child marriage, because it has no enforcement mechanisms adequate to end them.66 While they are correct to say these atrocities violate the rights of children as set out in the CRC, the conclusion that their continued occurrence is evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Convention is simply wrong. Examples include the laws I’ve already referred to. Critics also claim the CRC would undermine U.S. sovereignty. They contend that the CRC violates our American principle of federalism. Finally, they call the CRC anti-family and say it will reduce parental control over children in favor of government control. I’ll address each of these in turn. First, child trafficking and soldiering are largely perpetuated by criminals and outlaws, not governments that are parties to the Convention. Likewise, harmful cultural practices are carried out by families and religious groups, not formally by governments. The CRC is focused on government obligations. Second, the Convention is the first step, never meant to be the last, in addressing these problems. The CRC is not a criminal enforcement statute; rather, by establishing positive legal rights for children to be protected from abusive and harmful treatment, it provides an important legal framework that legislators and reformers can and should use, and have used, to advocate for domestic legislation, policies, and practices that enforce those rights within their own countries. As I previously indicated, many CRC critics fear that our U.S. ratification would undermine United States sovereignty and the principle of federalism. These concerns are neither new nor completely invalid. However, it is critical to note that the U.S. has adequately addressed them in the other human rights treaties it has ratified for over half a century through the use of Reservations. Reservations are an international treaty tool that allows countries to harmonize treaties with their domestic law and to leave all domestic implementation of treaty provisions to their legislatures.67 </document> <Summary> Critiques of the CRC come in three general forms.

"<document> All black people are involved in the struggle. Revolutionaries are not necessarily born poor or in the ghetto. There is a role for every person in revolution if he is revolutionary. You don’t have to throw a Molotov cocktail to be a revolutionary. One thing which the Black college student can do is to begin to legitimatize the brother’s actions - begin to articulate his position, because the college student has the skills that the blood doesn’t have. It reminds me of the old story about the father and his son. The son comes to the father and says, “You told me that the loin was the king of the jungle. Yet in every story I read, the man always beats the lion. Why is that?” The father looks at the son and says, “Son, the story will always end the same until the lion learns how to write.” If you don’t begin to tell your own story, you will always be Aunt Jemima; you will always be “rioting.” You must begin to articulate a position of your own. The Black college student, if he is revolutionary, can help Black people to purge themselves of the misinformation that they’ve been fed all lives. White nationalism has been instilled in us whether we know it or not. We have been told that George Washington is no hero of blacks. He had 13 children and none by Martha. They were slaves. They tell us we should celebrate Christopher Columbus was a 15th century Eisenhower. He was so dumb. He was trying to get to India Did you ever see where India is on a map?   But America has the power to legitimatize these people and make them heroes in our minds. America has negroes in the dilemma of thinking that everything black is bad. Black cows don’t give good milk. Black hens don’t lay eggs. Black mail is bad. You wear black to funerals and white to weddings. Angel food cake is white, devils food cake is black. And all good guys wear white hats. And black people fall for it. Everything black is bad. That’s white nationalism. And they tell you, you cant talk about black nationalism. So how do you combat it if you grow up telling your children that they respect Santa Claus. Come Dec 25 is santa claus is so white that he slides down a black chimney and comes out white. But you tell your children that santa claus brought these toys and you take them to see the white santa claus. So therefore it becomes instilled in their minds that santa claus is good because santa claus is white. Thus we help foster that type of white nationalism. You must begin to define for yourself; you must begin to define your black heritage. You must begin to investigate and learn on your own. They will never tell you that Hannibal is black. They’ll never tell you that there were black societies back in the 16th century and were the most modern at that time and the highest degree of their culture existed there. Every time you open a book here in America, they gonna show you uncle tom’s cabin or they gonna show you double O soul with a piece of watermelon. It is the responsibility of the black college student to combat this sort of thing. The education that a black student gets is irrelevant, fruitless and worthless unless he uses it to define and articulate positions that are relevant to the black people. It does you no good to come to school and cross the burning sand. Hell you aint never get off the burning sand. Pledging is no good for black people in America. When the man moves against you, your Omega sticker does not mean that he is going to pass you by. All it mean is he might take you to a different camp. If you must pledge, pledge to be a revolutionary. You are involved in the struggle whether you want to be or not. Your badge of involvement is your skin. Therefore, you got to quit walking around talking about those people out there acting crazy. Them!! That’s you!! Anything we do will have a profound impact on you. </document> <Summary> Revolutionaries are not necessarily born poor or in the ghetto.

"<document> President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December. </document> <Summary> President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders.

"<document> (CNN)Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to Asia, but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first. Amos Yee, the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore, drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. His father has reportedly apologized for his son's behavior, but the younger Yee could face up to three years in jail. Yee is not unique. Another dissident blogger in Singapore, Roy Ngerng, continues to suffer financial and legal pressure, including the loss of his job, because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, of corruption. Ngerng's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the Central Provident Fund, the government's compulsory pension program. Yee and Ngerng are two of many. The Committee To Protect Journalists' file on Singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases, some against politicians, others against citizens simply frustrated with their government. But it is not just Singapore where Internet activity comes under fire: On Monday in Malaysia, with much less of the international attention heaped on Amos Yee, five editors and executives from The Malaysian Insider were arrested over the site's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors, known as the Conference of Rulers, had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud, or punishments meted out under Islamic law. In deeply Muslim Malaysia, questions of Islamic faith are a third-rail issue, as is revealing government decisions before they are announced. By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. But in second place in Asia is Vietnam, where CPJ's most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1. Add one more in late December, Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, a prominent blogger who was arrested for ""law-violating"" after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27, and two more in January, Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho, arrested on anti-state charges of ""abusing democratic freedoms"" and you can see the pattern. Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled, mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam. Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam, their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013. Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage. The list could go on, but the reality is that, as CPJ wrote in 2013, across Asia ""governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses."" That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in Asia, and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon. Jailing journalists is one thing, but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another. Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online. Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the Internet, that proportion can be expected to grow. While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers, Bangladesh has recently become the exception. On Monday, Washiqur Rahman Babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in Bangladesh in the past five weeks. Blogger Avijit Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured. Both Rahman and Roy had written critically on Islamic matters. The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two, and religious beliefs are always involved, and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity. In January 2013, blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who wrote critical commentary on religion, Islamist groups, free speech, and human rights, barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists. In February 2013, blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group, according to police investigations. Later in 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy. While arrests were made after those murders, there have been no convictions. The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law. </document> <Summary> Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media.

"<document> If bleaching is the only factor stressing a coral reef it has a 70 per cent chance of recovery. The odds drop when you add in human stressors that in the Caribbean include mass tourism, hotel development, too much scuba diving in popular areas, the introduction of invasive marine species, overfishing, removal of coastal mangroves, coastal deforestation, chemical fertilizer runoff and animal waste from farming activities. Fortunately these are largely absent from Cuba’s southern coast. Combine this with sound public policy that created national marine parks here in 1996, and the Jardines de la Reina flourishes today. Overall health of the Jardines ecosystem allows it to thrive and recover quickly when stressed. The Jardines has survived Soviet-era chemical fertilizers, and the Long-spined urchin is making a comeback following a die-off in the 1980s. Today, Cuban agriculture is organic, and sound public policy based on scientific research works hand in hand with strict conservation laws that protect the Jardines de la Reina.

"<document> The basic political context for the discussion about white working class voters is the urgent challenge of the 2018 and 2020 elections. These elections will determine whether the horrendous outcome of the 2016 elections represented a wake-up call for progressives, or a nightmare that has only just begun. If Democrats do not make significant gains in the states in these two elections, Republicans will dominate another decennial round of redistricting that could place not only state legislatures but also the U.S. House out of reach until 2032. The odds of Republicans earning a “lock” on the House go up even more if Democrats don’t win a significant number of seats in the midterms and the next presidential year. Worse yet, if Republicans maintain “trifecta” control of the federal government beyond 2020, they will almost certainly impose policies on the country whose implications are difficult to project, but that transcend any present slicing and dicing of the electorate. Winning back a significant share of the white working class vote at some future juncture may come too late if the New Deal policies that once made them vote for Democrats have been consigned to the dustbin of history. So the specific challenges of 2018 and 2020 need to be at the front of every progressive’s mind in considering the long-term regeneration of our electoral coalition. </document> <Summary> The basic political context for the discussion about white working class voters is the urgent challenge of the 2018 and 2020 elections.

"<document> A plane seat specifically targeted at making plane travel more comfortable for obese passengers and small children has won a prize for its innovation vision this week. The adapted chair by SII Deutschland, beat off competition from 21 finalists to win the Passenger Comfort Hardware award at The Crystal Cabin Awards in Hamburg, Germany. Sitting at one-and-a-half times the width of a standard seat, the SANTO seat (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) aims to improve aircrew procedure and passenger safety. Passenger Comfort Hardware winner: The SANTO seat by SII Deutschland is larger than usual seats, and makes use of space at the back of aircraft where the fuselage narrows . The adapted seat would make use of the usually wasted space at the back of aircraft, where the fuselage narrows. It would be a larger version of the aircraft chairs, meaning a wider passenger could comfortably and safety fit in the chair, without disrupting the neighbouring customer. As the SANTO seat has an extra half a seat width, a baby seat could be fitted securely into the chair, with enough space for a regular customer to sit alongside without paying for an extra seat. The designs were judged by a team of 24 experts, including panel chairwoman Melissa Raudebaugh, General Manager of Aircraft Experience at Delta Air Lines. 'Selecting the Crystal Cabin Award winners was a tough decision this year, as all finalists were of very high quality - ranging from renowned manufacturers to inspiring university concepts, which we will hopefully see flying soon', said Raudebaugh, as reported by PR Newswire. The seat won the prize as part of the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, and addresses the issue of the safety for obese passengers . Not only being space effective, the larger chair aims to address the on-going debate about whether  to charge obese passengers for two seats. Some American airlines have adopted this principle if customers are unable to buckle their seatbelt without the use of a seatbelt extender. In 2011 a male passenger claims he was forced to stand for seven hours in the aisle of a plane on his US Airways flight, from Anchorage to Philadelphia, as a 400lb man took up a lot of his seat. Another solution was put forward by Samoa Air in 2013 charging customers depending on their weight, in a bid to reduce fuel costs. Visitors look at Expliseat wide seats weighing four kilos at  the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2014. It is the leading trade fair for aircraft cabin designers and presents novelties in design, entertainment and connectivity . The Crystal Cabin Awards were awarded as part of Aircraft Interiors Expo which aims to showcase world's most advanced and creative ideas for the aircraft cabin. The SANTO was not the only seat design aiming to solve the issue of comfort when it comes to overweight passengers. Expliseat also displayed wider seating designs to accommodate larger passnegers. Prestigious aviation companies such as B/E Aerospace and Etihad Airways showed their concepts at the international trade fair of aircraft interiors which took place from April 14 to 16. Other awarded ideas included B/E Aerospace's solar cell films on cabin windows, and a vacuum technology to reduce space of waste by lavatories and trash bags created by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. Premium Class & VIP: A380 Upper Deck by Etihad (UAE) One highlight this year was in the head-to-head A380-First Class race between two airlines from the United Arab Emirates. Etihad Airways won by a nose with its 'A380 Upper Deck'. Etihad is the first airline in the world to install a three room apartment in a commercial airliner, the 'Residence by Etihad'. Behind the Residence is the First Class Cabin with nine compartments and 70 Business Class seats. Greener Cabin, Health, Safety & Environment: Solar Eclipse by B/E Aerospace (USA) A thin solar cell film is installed in the sun visor of the cabin window, providing passengers with electricity to charge their electronic devices during flight. Although the system is still under development, the manufacturer is already working on achieving production approval soon. Industrial Design & Visionary Concepts: E2 Cabin Concept by Embraer (Brazil) The cabin for Embraers E2 generation of regional jets, is characterised by an innovative, easy maintenance design. The use of space is especially well thought-out. Special baggage lockers, for example, and a staggered seating concept, provide more space in the aircraft. Passenger Comfort Hardware: SANTO Seat by SII Deutschland (Germany) The 'SANTO Seat' (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) is beneficial for both passengers and airlines. The normally wasted space at the rear of the aircraft cabin, where the fuselage narrows, is used by a special seat, one-and-a-half times the width of a normal seat. The seat is ideal for overweight passengers and for passengers with small children. For these passengers, the seat is safer than a standard seat. Passenger Comfort Systems: Exede in the Air by ViaSat (USA) The satellite-powered 'Exede in the Air' solution brings a 12 Mbps internet connection to every seat, allowing passengers to stream films or shop online above the clouds without difficulty. Material & Components: LEXAN XHR2000 by SABIC Innovative Plastics (UAE) The 'LEXAN XHR2000' film has a transparency level of 80 percent, currently the highest possible level. Application possibilities range from windows to surface elements within the cabin, providing interior designers in particular with completely new possibilities. University: Trash Compactor by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (Germany) Marc Spille a student of aviation studies, in collaboration with Airbus, developed a mobile trash container which uses the vacuum technology of the on-board lavatory to compress trash bags into a space-saving format within seconds. </document> <Summary> A plane seat specifically targeted at making plane travel more comfortable for obese passengers and small children has won a prize for its innovation vision this week.

"<document> Speaker 2: Thank you. I will be moving on now to the next item, which will be item number 25.
Speaker 1: Please report from Public Works recommendation or request city attorney to prepare an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to speed limits on city streets citywide.
Speaker 2: Mr. Modica.
Speaker 7: The item before you is related to speed limits. As mentioned, we are available for a staff report if you want it.
Speaker 5: Otherwise we're ready with the recommendation.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry. Councilman Price.
Speaker 4: To do this because I know it's a late night, but. Mr. Lopez, can you just talk real briefly about how it is specifically in Belmont? Sure. That we came up with these recommendations or perhaps you can expand on what I miss here.
Speaker 4: It's my understanding that this has been a multiyear process where data has been collected and the speed, the recommended speeds have been warranted through national standards for speed design and roadway design standards. And that this is something that has been in the process for a number of years to get to this recommendation.
Speaker 4: The reason and if there's anything you want to add to that, please. But the reason I'm asking that is because we do have business owners in Naples that have been asking for a reduction of speeds on Second Street through Naples.
Speaker 4: And that's something staff is looking at. But they have to collect the data and they have to make sure the warrants are there to recommend it. And it could not have been just added on to this item. Does that sound about right to you?
Speaker 2: Yes. Actually, we have Carl Hickman. That's our city traffic engineer. That's our local expert. So if I can have Carl Hickman help me answer that question, Carl.
Speaker 5: Sure. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. And to answer your question, Susie, basically, you know, many of most of those streets and the Belmont Shore residents district, they have similar characteristics. They were all originally posted at 25 miles an hour.
Speaker 5: They are very narrow there. The GM metrics are very similar. The usage that is there is very similar. So all of these things make it appropriate, appropriate to designate the entire neighborhood as a common district. All of the speed surveys that we collected there show an 85th percentile speed between 19 and 23 miles an hour.
Speaker 5: Actually, 14 of the 18 were actually 22 miles an hour or less. So because so many common conditions exist per the vehicle code, we're able to create their residence district and change the speed limits, have a reduction down to 15 miles an hour for the entire group of streets.
Speaker 5: And we're talking CVC Section 22, three, five, 8.3. That allows us to do that per state law, and that's how we're able to accomplish that in the Belmont Shore area.
Speaker 4: Okay. And so having said all of that, that your team is still looking at speed reductions on Second Street through the area of Naples, and that is a process where you're collecting data, doing speed surveys and establishing the necessary warrants to make that recommendation, correct?
Speaker 5: Yes, Councilwoman, we're actually in the process of reviewing all of the speed surveys in the entire city. These speed surveys are required so that PD has a formal and legal process to enforce our speed limits. We have over 300 engineering and traffic surveys that we have to maintain, and these require a renewal on the five year basis
Speaker 5: . And sometimes we can also extend them seven or ten years. But yes, to answer your question, we will be reviewing those roadways as well at second and other areas as well throughout the entire city. And this is the first step in the process.
Speaker 5: And I can remind you all that we did pass a Safe Streets initiative back in July of last year. And this is part of our process to see where there are areas in the city where we can formally and legally reduce our speed limits to make our city's streets safer.
Speaker 4: Great. Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's when Austin. Is there a public comment on this item? No these cats votes.

The item before you is related to speed limits. As mentioned, we are available for a staff report if you want it.
Otherwise we're ready with the recommendation.
Oh, I'm sorry. Councilman Price.
To do this because I know it's a late night, but. Mr. Lopez, can you just talk real briefly about how it is specifically in Belmont? Sure. That we came up with these recommendations or perhaps you can expand on what I miss here.
It's my understanding that this has been a multiyear process where data has been collected and the speed, the recommended speeds have been warranted through national standards for speed design and roadway design standards. And that this is something that has been in the process for a number of years to get to this recommendation.
The reason and if there's anything you want to add to that, please. But the reason I'm asking that is because we do have business owners in Naples that have been asking for a reduction of speeds on Second Street through Naples.
And that's something staff is looking at. But they have to collect the data and they have to make sure the warrants are there to recommend it. And it could not have been just added on to this item. Does that sound about right to you?
Yes. Actually, we have Carl Hickman. That's our city traffic engineer. That's our local expert. So if I can have Carl Hickman help me answer that question, Carl.
Sure. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. And to answer your question, Susie, basically, you know, many of most of those streets and the Belmont Shore residents district, they have similar characteristics. They were all originally posted at 25 miles an hour.
They are very narrow there. The GM metrics are very similar. The usage that is there is very similar. So all of these things make it appropriate, appropriate to designate the entire neighborhood as a common district. All of the speed surveys that we collected there show an 85th percentile speed between 19 and 23 miles an hour.
Actually, 14 of the 18 were actually 22 miles an hour or less. So because so many common conditions exist per the vehicle code, we're able to create their residence district and change the speed limits, have a reduction down to 15 miles an hour for the entire group of streets.
And we're talking CVC Section 22, three, five, 8.3. That allows us to do that per state law, and that's how we're able to accomplish that in the Belmont Shore area.
Okay. And so having said all of that, that your team is still looking at speed reductions on Second Street through the area of Naples, and that is a process where you're collecting data, doing speed surveys and establishing the necessary warrants to make that recommendation, correct?
Yes, Councilwoman, we're actually in the process of reviewing all of the speed surveys in the entire city. These speed surveys are required so that PD has a formal and legal process to enforce our speed limits. We have over 300 engineering and traffic surveys that we have to maintain, and these require a renewal on the five year basis
. And sometimes we can also extend them seven or ten years. But yes, to answer your question, we will be reviewing those roadways as well at second and other areas as well throughout the entire city. And this is the first step in the process.
And I can remind you all that we did pass a Safe Streets initiative back in July of last year. And this is part of our process to see where there are areas in the city where we can formally and legally reduce our speed limits to make our city's streets safer.
Great. Thank you.
That's when Austin. Is there a public comment on this item? No these cats votes. </Summary>"

Kenny Jackett’s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory. Wolves substitute David Edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . Edwards is congratulated by his Wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against Leeds . Wolves striker Benik Afobe slides on his knees after scoring his side's third goal of the afternoon . WOLVES (4-4-2): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne; Henry (Van la Parra 78mins), McDonald, Price, Sako; Afobe, Dicko (Edwards 70) Subs not used: Kuszczak, Doherty, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell, Hause .

Booked: Wooton, Byram, Bamba . Goal: Taylor 11, Batth OG 65, Mowatt 74 . Referee: David Coote . Attendance: 25,169 . With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday’s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds’ banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett’s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves’ rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder’s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price’s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt’s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of ‘leave it’ could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald’s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place. Leeds United celebrate after Charlie Taylor puts Neil Redfearn's side in the lead during the Molineux clash . </document> <Summary> If the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs, then watch out for Wolves.

Speaker 3: There are a few things in our city that aren't made better by the work of our city employees. We saw during the last storm how essential our Boston Public Works employees really are. And for many of them, this isn't just about collecting a paycheck.
Speaker 3: Their jobs aren't just what they do. It's who they are. Over the past several months, I have been in deep communication and meeting with these workers to learn about their experiences working for the city. In each meeting, we heard the same story.
Speaker 3: Workers of color, some who have been city employees for nearly 30 years, have been routinely denied opportunities to advance their careers to obtain higher wages. A quick look at the city's employment dashboard reveals this to be true. According to the Demographics dashboard as of January 2022, while white employees made up 48.9% of the total workforce, they disproportionately
Speaker 3: represented 61.6 of employees making over 80,000 a year. Even in departments with large percentages of employees of color, the top earners are predominantly white, such as the Department of Public Works, where black and brown employees make up nearly half of the total of the workforce.
Speaker 3: But only 10% of the top ten earners. We have heard from workers of color who have been tasked with training newer, less experienced, predominantly white employees for positions above them, meaning that they are somehow experienced enough to train management but not experience enough to be management.
Speaker 3: We have also heard from qualified city employees who sought to seek higher levels of employment, only to be passed over for a buddy or a relative of a hiring manager. In hearings, we have asked questions to numerous departments as to why they do not have a more diverse workforce.
Speaker 3: Each time we ask this question. We hear a similar response that the talent just isn't there. After meeting with countless workers of color, each of whom have demonstrated their expertize, their passion and their commitment to the city, it is clear that the talent is there, but we're just not utilizing it.
Speaker 3: This is why we are failing. The Boston Fair. Chance at the Fair Chance Act formally codifies a chief diversity officer position who will work with all city agencies to develop a detailed plan for hiring minority employees, women employees, LGBTQ plus employees and employees with disabilities.
Speaker 3: A detailed plan for promotion of State Employees. A detailed plan for improving work place culture, preventing harassment, intimidation and bullying. And a detailed plan for disseminating this information to covered employees. The Chief Diversity Officer will also take the steps to ensure that opportunities for nepotism or workforce discrimination are eliminated.
Speaker 3: We have the capacity in Boston to create a workforce that is representative of our communities and representative our commitment to economic empowerment. I look forward to this conversation and to strengthening this ordinance alongside my colleagues. You know, I just have to say, in being in deep community with a lot of our city employees, many of which were
Speaker 3: even afraid to speak up, it just goes to show that the volume of importance that this particular conversation has in this moment in time to ensure that we're moving the needle when it comes to ensuring that all people have the opportunity to rise up.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Here. The chair recognizes Councilor Arroyo. Counsel Arroyo, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Gray. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Heath, who summarizes really well. What I'll just add to this is I think it's incredibly, incredibly important that as a city, we ensure that residents are qualified to get employed, are promoted, get
Speaker 0: a fair chance at doing so. And my hope is that these changes help make a fairer and more just process when it. And frankly, a more transparent process when it comes to how we decide and make hires and promotions in the city of Boston.
Speaker 0: And so I look forward to working on this with council, and I'm grateful to councilman here for for our work in this. Thank you. Thank you. Council Royal. Is anyone else looking to speak on this matter? If you are, can you.
Speaker 0: Can you raise your hand? I don't see anyone wishing to speak on this matter. If you would like. If you would like to add your name, would you please raise your hand at this time? Mr. Clarke Can you hear it?
Speaker 0: Councilor Fernandez Anderson, Council LRA. Councilor Murphy Council of Rate and Council Lodging Council where. Council of City Council a block. Please add the chair. I don't see I don't see anyone else's name. Anyone else's hand. Docket 0259 will be referred to the Committee on Government Operations.

"<document> An Australian businesswoman has come out on top against the world's 13th richest billionaire after stopping BeneFit Cosmetics from using the term 'Brow Bar' exclusively. Beautician Chernae Noonan, who founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar, has blocked the cosmetic giant's application to trademark the phrase. BeneFit is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), which is run by luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault. Australian beautician Chernae Noonan founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar in 2003 . Mr Arnault's estimate wealth is thought to be $37.4 billion and makes him the second richest person in France, according to Forbes. The case between Ms Noonan and BeneFit was heard in the Australian Trade Marks Office earlier this year in February and ruled in the Queensland woman's favour. Ms Noonan started her business in 2003 in her Springwood home and since then it has seen 'significant growth'. She has rolled out six stores across Australia - including on the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne. She has stopped BeneFit Cosmetics from using 'Brow Bar' exclusively after the company launched an application to trademark the term in Australia . The Brow Bar services 'women of relatively high disposable income aged 25 to 55' along with a small group of men. Ms Noonan took action against BeneFit when the cosmetics giant sought to trademark 'Brow Bar' in Australia in 2011. BeneFit is owned by luxury goods company LVMH, which is run by the world's 13th richest billionaire, Bernard Arnault (pictured) She said customers would confuse her business, The Brow Bar, with BeneFit Brow Bar at Myer stores in Western Australia, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. According to the ruling, Ms Noonan said journalists, media writers and online forum contributors often confused the two. Lawyers for BeneFit told the Australian Trade Marks Office the company had already trademarked the term in Hong Kong and Mexico, and had been using the name in its United States stores since 2003. Hearing officer Nicole Worth said she did not consider the word 'Brow Bar' to be used commonly enough to be deemed as 'generic' as lawyers for BeneFit argued. She added the addition of the word 'BeneFit' to 'Brow Bar' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant's services from Ms Noonan's business. 'Additionally, although [BeneFit] did not know of [Ms Noonan's] trademark when it adopted the phrase ""browbar"" in the USA, it is reasonable to expect that it ought to have checked the Australian market for conflicting trade marks before entering it,' Ms Worth said. 'It also continued to expand its business under the [trademark] in the knowledge that a prior conflicting mark was registered and being used... That it did so is a risk it chose to bear.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Noonan for further comment but she did not wish to as BeneFit is appealing the decision. A statement on the matter has also been sought from the cosmetics brand. </document> <Summary> An Australian businesswoman has come out on top against the world's 13th richest billionaire after stopping BeneFit Cosmetics from using the term 'Brow Bar' exclusively.

"<document> Speaker 2: Agenda Item nine Resolution 31802 regarding civil legal aid project with the King County Department of Public Defense and its scope of Work for Representation Services, the committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Herbold.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So in the 2016 budget process, this council supported funding for what we're calling the Collateral Consequences attorneys as part of a city funded legal aid pilot program. The pilot program has been created to prevent people from losing their housing and having other collateral consequences when they are in the midst of a legal defense for an
Speaker 2: unrelated offense. Prior to the pilot, the attorneys at the King County Public Department of Public Defense under contract with the city to provide statutorily required defense services, were actually prohibited from working to address these collateral consequences. The creation of this pilot has allowed specialized staff with the King County Department of Public Defender to advocate for the accused
Speaker 2: , keep their housing during the legal review and plea bargaining processes. Stage two of this pilot anticipates the inclusion of direct representation of King County Department of Public Defense's criminal justice clients in civil proceedings with a primary focus on eviction.
Speaker 2: The there are other areas that the pilot focuses on in addition to eviction, as we heard during public comment, some of them ranging from intervening on behalf of a defendant's rights to maintain their their their employment licensing requirements, financial support services such as disability, as well as other types of civil civil issues that that come up during
Speaker 2: the during the course of a of a defense. Last month, I convened a group of civil legal aid stakeholders, as well as tenant services providers in order to talk about the progress of the pilot program. The between July and December of 2017.
Speaker 2: There were 293 cases where Collateral Consequences attorneys were used, and the folks meeting with us last month helped to influence and shape the resolution that you have with you in front of you today. One of the amendments that we raised during the committee process to specifically incorporate feedback would be outlining an intention to regularly convene a civil
Speaker 2: legal aid coordination group in order to bring together the attorneys providing legal aid with the actual service providers that these cases touch in some ways. As you heard today in public comment, the services provided by this pilot have real life implications for decreasing unreasonable consequences for people who have been charged and not convicted with a crime.
Speaker 2: It is modeled on the Bronx Defender approach towards public defense, which recognizes that these services must be provided in a way that's holistic in order to avoid future negative impacts arising from from the the collateral consequences of some of these cases.
Speaker 2: So look forward to having councilmembers support on this resolution, which will help set out the steps for the next stages of this pilot, which move from the consultation of the public defenders with the collateral consequences attorneys to the direct representation in some cases.
Speaker 0: Excellent. Any further comments? I just like to think I'm sorry, Herbold, for bringing this forward as I'm very, extremely supportive. And I think the public testimony we receive from many of the attorneys involved in this to do a deeper dove on what's happening out there, these kinds of problems.
Speaker 0: And I think this is a great both policy strategy as well as well should be an investment strategy. Thank you for bringing that forward. Any further comments? But those in favor of adopting the resolution please vote i. I.

"<document> Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Gunmen stormed the headquarters of Somalia's education ministry in the country's capital on Tuesday after a suicide car bombing, a two-pronged attack that killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others, officials said. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours. Among those killed was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

"<document> One empirical mapping connects feminist inflected activism to the transformation of social policy in the 1970s and beyond. It traces how women came to influence policy in order to expand benefits for women (as independent citizens) and to promote improved provision for children. The following is an extract from an interview with a social policy academic: We developed a critique of the male breadwinner model out of our own family experience. We used our professional skills to send evidence off to policy makers, working on issues of taxation, pensions, child benefit, family law, domestic violence and so on. In the 1970s there was a concern to improve the lot of women; and in some ways it was as if we were pushing at an open door. It got harder in the 1980s, it was quite hard to get a handle on Thatcher - the paradigm had shifted, the door had slammed and we had far fewer networks with policymakers. The Y B a Wife campaign and Rights of Women emerged out of the original financial and legal independence campaign, and the Women’s Budget group is a continuation of these in some respects. I therefore saw this [involvement in the WBG] as enabling me to do the things I had done in the 1970s again. I worked on issues of childcare and social care, maternity provision, work life balance etc. The WBG always comments on pre-budget reports and writes submissions to the Treasury on their impact on women. There were some ministers and civil servants who were happy to use our arguments but you trained them up and then they moved on to another policy area. We had some successes: the value of gender impact statements was finally accepted by the last New Labour government 9 However, the label comes off as soon as it gets into government – it’s very hard to trace a specific policy back to its origins. You just sow these little seeds and hope that something grows from them. There are several points that can be drawn from this account: the extent of feminist networks that connected campaigners, academics and policy actors; the breadth and variety of the feminist agenda; patterns of change over time; and the ambivalence of the outcomes. This work can be viewed as complicit with the turn towards a ‘social investment state’ that constituted women as full worker citizens, and enabled capitalist and state enterprises to access cheaper, more flexible, less unionised workforce, as well as investing in the capacity of future generations to take their part as productive worker citizens in the global economy (Lister, 2004). The selective incorporation of gender agendas here can be viewed as a triumph of neo-liberal forms of appropriation of feminist politics (though as noted earlier, some feminist scholars have argued that it represented something ‘after’ neoliberalism). In the same period concerns about parenting, family stability and care became amplified. These projects addressed women as citizen-subjects in different ways, the first calling on women to participate in the economy as full adult worker citizens; the second interpellating them as carers, parents and responsible citizens. One might, then, depict feminism as functional to neoliberalism in two different, and contradictory ways. In the first, the expanded role of female labour – more flexible, less unionised and more suited to the service economy – can be viewed as constitutive of a new economic order of flexible accumulation. In the second, women are viewed as integral to advanced neoliberal strategies of governing the social, sustaining the domestic economy that reproduces the conditions of capital accumulation. However such functionalist readings offer limited purchase on the contradictions at stake in the regendering of the economy and society. In each case neoliberal projects were themselves transformed - in part - through their encounters with feminist and other activist claims. Employers came to bear the ‘costs’ of equality governance, parental leave and more complex patterns of work demanded by women’s entry as full worker citizens. Welfare states, while looking to curb benefits paid to ‘dependent’ women, had to invest in development, empowerment and training and to launch a multiplicity of ‘social’ programmes in order to enable women both to contribute to the economy and to manage care work. </document> <Summary> One empirical mapping connects feminist inflected activism to the transformation of social policy in the 1970s and beyond.

Speaker 3: The committee recommends the bill passed.
Speaker 0: Council Member Skater.
Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. And Council Bill 119236 passed unanimously out of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee. This legislation amends the housing funding policies which allow for strategic acquisition and including acquiring options by the Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development.
Speaker 7: So to break that down, that means that the Office of Housing is able to use the Acquisition and Preservation Program resources to purchase property and secure it for critical, long term, affordable housing development opportunities. Most immediately, as you heard, that this amendment will be able to help facilitate the acquisition of two Seattle satellite owned substations by the
Speaker 7: Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development. I think we all know that this is a critical, important step for us to take in an effort to make sure that there's more affordable housing options. It accomplishes multiple goals.
Speaker 7: First, increasing affordable housing locations with a near major transit investments throughout our city, and those investments that are expected to come online soon. Number two, increasing access to neighborhoods with little to no existing affordable housing options. Number three, promoting anti displacement and stabilization goals.
Speaker 7: And fourth, pursuing site assembly that leverages existing public property. This all means that when we see a piece of property, a piece of real estate that's on the market, we can act with urgency to make sure that the city can acquire it.
Speaker 7: This quickness is needed to make sure that we acquire properties that are often to too quick to go in this hot market. They go quickly and we want to make sure that the city has every tool in its tool belt to be a competitor and get those pieces of property in hand.
Speaker 7: At the same time, we want to make sure that all parcels of publicly owned land stay in publicly owned hands. This will help us be more equipped to make sure that we are both developing and preserving housing to meet our community's needs, especially for low income and moderate income families.
Speaker 7: As I mentioned this morning, I think this is an incredible addition to the work that we will be talking about later this evening in the conversation around the progressive tax and in the conversations that are ongoing around expanding MJ throughout the city.
Speaker 7: I want to thank the Office of Housing for working with our office, specifically Michael Maddox, and for Central Staff's work to bring this legislation forward. Thank you to Tracy and for all the work that's gone into this. I think this is a great tool.
Speaker 7: It might not sound very exciting acquisition of financing, but it's a really critical tool for our efforts to make sure that there's affordable housing and affordable land throughout the city.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much for the comments. Caspar Herbold.
Speaker 6: I just wanted to thank Councilmember Musgrave for bringing forward this amendment. I too have a Seattle City Light substation in my district that community members in the Highland Park area are very, very interested in the Office of Housing acquiring for the development of housing.
Speaker 6: But because of the zoning in the neighborhood, it is considered to be a site for increased zoning capacity under MSA. But even under that increased zoning, because of the the size of the parcel, there was some concern that it might not pencil out if a low income housing provider had to pay for the site acquisition as well
Speaker 6: . So I'm hopeful that now that we can bring some different assumptions to what the development costs will be for this particular location, the do more station, that this could be a site that the Office of Housing could look at in the future.
Speaker 6: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Okay, good. I think we're ready to vote, so please call the roll on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 1: Johnson. Whereas macheda I. O'Brien I want I. Make sure I. Gonzalez, I. Herbold hi. President Harrell.
Speaker 0: Hi.
Speaker 1: Nine in favor and unopposed.
Speaker 0: Bill passed and chair of the Senate. Please read the report. The Planning Land Use and Zoning Committee.
 </document> <Summary> This legislation amends the housing funding policies which allow for strategic acquisition and including acquiring options by the Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development.
So to break that down, that means that the Office of Housing is able to use the Acquisition and Preservation Program resources to purchase property and secure it for critical, long term, affordable housing development opportunities.
Most immediately, as you heard, that this amendment will be able to help facilitate the acquisition of two Seattle satellite owned substations by the Office of Housing for future Affordable Housing Development.
First, increasing affordable housing locations with a near major transit investments throughout our city, and those investments that are expected to come online soon.
Number two, increasing access to neighborhoods with little to no existing affordable housing options.
This all means that when we see a piece of property, a piece of real estate that's on the market, we can act with urgency to make sure that the city can acquire it. </Summary>"

"<document> Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a two-day visit, Abadi’s first since assuming office in September 2014. During Abadi’s visit, China and Iraq issued a joint statement upgrading their relationship to a strategic partnership. In a meeting with Abadi, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the development of China-Iraq ties, and said that the new strategic partnership would provide “a solid foundation” for future advances in the relationship. Xi also pledged Chinese assistance in “energy, electricity, communication and infrastructure” projects in Iraq, which he tied to China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. In his own meeting with Abadi, Premier Li Keqiang repeated that promise, and also mentioned building up Iraq’s production capacity in certain manufacturing industries. But energy in particular remains in the bedrock of China-Iraq relations, as China’s oil imports have skyrocketed over the past decade. China imported just 1 million tonnes of oil from Iraq during the whole year of 2006. By contrast, in January of 2015 alone, China received 3.4 million tonnes of oil from Iraq, making the country Beijing’s second-largest oil supplier (behind only Saudi Arabia). Chinese oil firms expected to import about three tonnes of oil per month from Iraq in 2015. Overall, China imports nearly half of Iraq’s total oil production. On Tuesday, China and Iraq signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on oil and gas, pledging a “long-term and comprehensive strategic partnership on energy cooperation.” The two countries vowed to expand their already-considerable cooperation in the energy field, with more investment going to boost the oil trade as well as exploration and development of oil and gas fields and the construction of infrastructure for storing and transporting energy resources. However, expanding energy cooperation is easier said than done. China’s existing oil investments in Iraq face threats from security concerns, notably the Islamic State. While Chinese-invested oilfields (which are largely clustered in southern Iraq) have mostly been spared from the IS threat, the crisis within Iraq has seriously limited the country’s ability to extract and export oil as planned. In 2014, China and Iraq were supposed to double their oil trade due to new contracts and investment from Chinese firms; only half of that increase was actually realized. Despite the impact on its energy imports, China has stayed out of the fight against IS, despite nudges from Iraqi government officials for more aid from Beijing. China voices support for Iraq’s government, but is only willing to provide modest support in the form of limited personnel training and humanitarian aid. Similarly, the joint statement signed between Iraq and China this week saw Beijing pledge to “support Iraq’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence” without making any specific commitments. Meanwhile, both Beijing and Baghdad promised to “to support each other’s efforts to maintain national security, stability and to fight against terrorism.” Abadi’s visit to China comes as he pushes back against the idea of deploying U.S. ground troops in Iraq. Abadi told NPR in a recent interview that “we don’t want boots on the ground. Full stop.” Instead, he said, the United States and its coalition should increase their commitment to air strikes against IS, calling the current level of support “limited.” “We can destroy Daesh… But we need proper intelligence and proper air cover and support,” Abadi said. That’s not something China can (or is willing to) provide, despite Beijing’s own serious concerns about terrorism. Instead, Beijing is continuing to offer the same prescription for Iraq: economic cooperation, focused on the energy sector. </document> <Summary> Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a two-day visit, Abadi’s first since assuming office in September 2014.

"<document> (CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV's ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when ""The Dukes of Hazzard's"" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his ""hot pursuit"" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive ""kew-kew-kew"" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as ""cuff 'em and stuff 'em!"" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's ""Hazzard"" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. ""I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,"" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. ""Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend."" ""Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,"" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. ""Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions."" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Gunsmoke."" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including ""Hooper"" and ""The End."" But Best will always be best known for his ""Hazzard"" role, which lives on in reruns. ""Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,"" Latshaw said. ""I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier."" People we've lost in 2015 . CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this story. </document> <Summary> (CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P.

"<document> They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they’re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger’s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply. </document> <Summary> They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter.

"<document> Sam Allardyce has warned Brendan Rodgers that putting Raheem Sterling on a bumper new contract could cause a ripple effect across the rest of the Liverpool squad. The West Ham manager feels paying Sterling more than the £100,000-per-week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20-year-old's team-mates demanding more. Yet Allardyce does not blame Sterling, currently on £35,000 a week at Liverpool, for trying to get as much as possible. Big Sam feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available. Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling has stalled over signing a new contract at the Anfield club . Sam Allardyce believes that giving Sterling a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other Liverpool players . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club's best players . 'When the supply is far less than the demand, then you've got very big demands from the youngster, who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about,' Allardyce said. 'Not just in the country but in Europe in general, if not in the world. 'The demand is out there. The supply is minimal. A lot less than we want it to be. Hence that gives it a value. When that comes around it's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand. 'It reflects down the way from there on in, by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that.' Allardyce feels if a club were to buy the England international, who currently has two years left on his contract at Liverpool, then they would not only be getting a player, but a brand. 'If a player is in his position like Raheem Sterling, then you're going to look at his value,' Allardyce added. 'Not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding. 'You have to remember that we're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend. The agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club, and the value of that to him and their brand, and they ask for that sort of money.' Sterling drags the ball back ahead of the oncoming challenge from Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas (left) Sterling scored his first goal for England during the 4-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . Big Sam was speaking ahead of West Ham's match with the Barclays Premier League's bottom-club Leicester City on Saturday. The game will see Allardyce reunited with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson after they worked together at Newcastle United in 2007. Pearson has been involved in several controversial incidents this season, including grabbing Crystal Palace's James McArthur by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference. It added to speculation Pearson will be sacked but Allardyce defended the man that was once a coach under him at St James' Park. 'Nigel was there (at Newcastle) when I arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time,' Allardyce said. 'I always thought he was management material and I think he left just after I left, then moved into management and has been very successful. 'I suppose in the end Nigel is a very, very, very, very honest man. He says it how it is. Perhaps that's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly, but he knows who he is. He knows what he wants. He knows how to try to achieve it.'

Is this sovereign power represented in the concentration camps really a constitutive feature of sover- eignty tout court? Even limiting ouselves to the remarks above, we can imagine a liberal critique of this position that asks from where come the limitations that Agamben concedes previous Weimar governments had observed. Surely, one does not have to accept in its entirety a normative liberal conception of sovereign power in order to appreciate that the demand for a factual ac- counting for the decision on the exception, and institutional checks upon the totalization of the space of exception, can none- theless-at least in certain instances-be effective. Indeed, one could go further and suggest that a liberal theory of sovereign power understands full well the paradoxical relation between law and fact, norm and exception; and, precisely in light of such an understanding constructs an institutional system that cannot re- solve the paradox but nonetheless attempts to prevent it from reaching an intensified and catastrophic conclusion. Given that Agamben is a nuanced and fair-minded thinker, one must won- der about why he largely ignores such a system. We think that one possible answer is that,just as for Agamben the source of the problem is not the institutional operation of sovereign power, but its object-bare life-so too the solution is not a prolifera- tion of institutional safeguards but a rethinking of that mode of being.

"<document> Two women who were part of a group that repeatedly searched Mississippi's capital city for black people to assault were sentenced Thursday to multiple years in federal prison for their role in the 2011 hate killing of 47-year-old James Craig Anderson. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Thursday sentenced Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21, of Pearl to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police. In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, Wingate also sentenced Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, of Crystal Springs to five years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit a hate crime. Went in search of black men to assault: Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21 (left) was sentenced to 8 years in prison and Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, (left) was given 5 years for their role in the horrific 2011 murder of 47-year-old Jackson, Mississippi man James Craig Anderson . Horrific: Graves and Richards were in the car when a group of white teens drove from their suburban town after a party with the specific intent of assaulting black men in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica'. James Anderson was one of their victims. He died after being beaten and run over by a truck . Both women were riding in a truck that fatally ran over Anderson in June 2011. Anderson died after being beaten and run over. Both women read letters of apology to Anderson's bereaved family, writes the Clarion-Ledger. 'It was the worst decision of my life,' Richards said as she wept. 'I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts...and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life.' Graves told the court she's haunted every day by Anderson's face. 'I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd, and I've asked myself so many times, 'Why was I so afraid?' Graves said. 'I pray that not only God and Mr. Anderson can forgive me, but that his family can one day forgive me.' Their day of sentencing was not that day. Anderson's sister told the girls: . 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire.' Hiding their faces: The family of Shelbie Richards hide their faces from photographers outside the federal courthouse in Jackson following Richards' sentencing Thursday . Lost a brother: Anderson's sister Barbara Anderson Young told Richards and Graves in court Thursday, 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire' Maximum sentence: Attorney Merrida Coxwell reflects on the sentencing of his client Shelbie Brooke Richards to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police . Unthinkable: Hotel surveillance video obtained by  media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Anderson's partner James Bradfield was similarly unforgiving. The days are never the same. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries...On a sunny day, all I can see is Craig out there working in the yard, trying to do everything he could for his family, and you took his life for no reason,' he said. 'And you didn't want to turn yourself in. You thought you'd get away with it.' Six white men, sentenced earlier by a different judge, received prison terms ranging from four to 50 years for Anderson's death. Two more men await sentencing after Thursday's hearings. Both Richards and Graves have acknowledged that they helped recruit people at a birthday party to take part in the venture that eventually led to Anderson's death in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica.' Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck. Hotel surveillance video obtained by The Associated Press and other media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Richards also acknowledged that later that month she lied to Jackson police detectives about the incident and her participation. The 10 defendants have pleaded guilty to other racially motivated attacks, including the beating of a black man near a Jackson golf course, the beating of another man who tried to sell the suburbanites drugs, attacks on pedestrians using beer bottles and a slingshot, and an attempt to run down another black man. Prosecutors said the suspects usually sought out people who were homeless or drunk. Other than Anderson, the black people who were assaulted have not been identified.

The stark warning comes from General Keith Alexander, the retired four-star general and former chief of the National Security Agency. 'The greatest risk is a catastrophic attack on the energy infrastructure. We are not prepared for that,' he warned. Scroll down for video . Former NSA chief General Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hacker's prime target . Alexander, who led the U.S. battle against cyber-threats for much of the last decade, was speaking at a private dinner held by IHS CERAWeek in Texas last week, reports the Daily Telegraph. He envisioned a worst case-scenario where hackers targeted oil refineries, power stations, and the electric grid. The payments nexus of the major banks could also be paralysed he warned. 'We need something like an integrated air-defence system for the whole energy sector,' he said. Alexander listed five countries able to conduct cyber-warfare at the highest level: the US, UK, Israel, Russia and Iran. The current NSA chief Michael Rogers testified late last year that China is capable of cyber-attacks that could cause 'catastrophic failures' of the water system or the electricity grid. There is no suggestion that China has an intention to use its power to damage US infrastructure. NSA officials are less confident that Iran will show self-restraint. Alexander also voice his concern about the hacking threat from a terrorist organization such as ISIS. He said that the U.S. and her allies had failed to check the advance of ISIS and its expanding network of franchises across the Middle East. </document> <Summary> The U.S. and her allies are growing a rush of a systemic cycled assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hackers primes target.

"<document> A florist in eastern Washington state fined $1,000 for refusing to sell a same-sex couple wedding flowers and also facing a consumer-protection lawsuit has netted more than $87,000 in a crowdfunding campaign. The Seattle Times reports that nearly half of the money on the gofundme.com page set up in February for 70-year-old Barronelle Stutzman came in the last several days. Supporters compare Stutzman's benefit page to an Indiana pizza shop that raised more than $800,000 after closing when the owner said the shop wouldn't cater a gay wedding. Supporters: An online campaign for Richland, Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman (pictured) has raised over $87,000 after the florist was fined for refusing to provide a gay couple with flowers for their 2013 wedding . Refused service: Couple Robert Ingersoll (left) and Curt Freed (right) were longtime customers at Stutzman's shop, and while she was fine providing them flowers before, she cited her religious beliefs when declining to service their wedding . Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Richland, Washington, received the fine in Benton County Superior Court in March after refusing to serve same-sex couple Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed in 2013. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her 'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. After they were refused flowers, Ingersoll and Freed went ahead with a smaller wedding than they had planned. They got married in their home with 11 guests and flowers from another florist. In a February ruling, Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. Along with the fine, the judge's ruling also requires that everything Arlene's Flowers sells to opposite-sex couples has to be available at the same price to same-sex couples. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office requested the fine, said in a statement Friday that the ruling is a reminder of the reach of Washington's anti-discrimination laws. 'My primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,' Ferguson said. 'I'm pleased that today's ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.' Before Ferguson's office filed the consumer-protection lawsuit against Stutzman, it had sent her a letter asking for an agreement to no longer discriminate, which she refused. Ferguson's statement Friday said the office would not have sued if Stutzman had accepted the agreement .

"<document> He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club’s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits. Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon’s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October’s 8-0 defeat at Southampton – and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. ‘Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,’ said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. ‘We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He’s brought the enjoyment back. ‘I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . ‘We had to change something. It wasn’t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. ‘I was asking myself, “What is happening?”. We couldn’t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn’t know what we could do to be better.’ The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. ‘He has tried to bring us together as a group,’ explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat’s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. ‘We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It’s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people’s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . ‘On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. ‘Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. ‘The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). ‘It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.’ Both of Pantilimon’s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . ‘I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,’ said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. ‘My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. ‘But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. ‘Thankfully, I didn’t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . ‘I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. ‘I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper. I thought I could get right to the top, I’ve worked hard to be here and I don’t want to stop, I want to get better and better.’ Under Advocaat, things are certainly looking up, for Pantilimon and Sunderland. </document> <Summary> Costel Pantilimon, Sunderland's goalkeeper, feared for his and the club's top-flight status after conceding four goals in 45 minutes four weeks ago.
Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone, and admits there has been a definite mood change under new manager Dick Advocaat.
Advocaat has tried to bring the team together, encouraging them to eat lunch together and be aggressive on the pitch.
Pantilimon, who was a striker as a child, was advised by his father to become a goalkeeper due to his physical attributes.
Under Advocaat, things are looking up for Pantilimon and Sunderland. </Summary>"

"<document> Speaker 7: Agenda item three. Resolution 31598. Affirming the human right to privacy and expressing a desire that the policies and products of the Cities Privacy Initiative be consistent with the right to privacy, as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the applicable international human rights framework.
Speaker 7: The committee recommends a resolution be adopted as amended.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.
Speaker 3: Thank you, President Burgess. So this resolution affirms the human right to privacy as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and expressed and expresses the City Council's desire that any policies or products of the Privacy Initiative be consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to Privacy.
Speaker 3: Now, let me describe a little bit about about that conceptual framework. So you know what I'm talking about. I don't assume that all of you have read the Declaration of Human Rights, quote, No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his or her privacy, family harm or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his or her honor and
Speaker 3: reputation. Everyone has a right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. And the reason why this policy work becomes critically important is because, you know, we as a as a city come into contact with a lot of personal information through our surveillance, through the bills that you pay, through your interface with the city
Speaker 3: . And how we treat that information on our private citizens becomes critically important. And we formed an internal departmental team on looking at what we do with this information. So we thought as a committee and as a council that it was prudent to look at the universal laws, the declarations.
Speaker 3: The policy statement said, in fact, this country has adopted to be the sort of the framework on how we move forward. A little background on what we're trying to do with privacy. In 2012, we adopted Resolution 31420, which proclaims the Seattle to be a human rights city.
Speaker 3: And we endorsed human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You should know that many major cities in this country have not adopted this. We are one of these cities that have adopted this. In 2014, we began a privacy initiative, and this is intended to strengthen the city's privacy practice and again, in how we treat
Speaker 3: your sensitive and personal and private information. In February of 2015, we passed Resolution 31570, adopting six privacy principles, guiding the actions that the city will take when collecting and using information from the public. And on August 2015, in the future, we will report back on the privacy statement, the privacy tool kit, which will establish actionable privacy standards
Speaker 3: to enable our departments to comply with our privacy principles. So to many, this becomes critically, critically important as we move forward as a city and as the advances of technology gives the government access to technology that decades ago people would not even imagine.
Speaker 3: I'd like to thank the Seattle Human Rights Commission and the Seattle Privacy Coalition. We incorporated much of their feedback into these policy statements. The committee recommends full adoption of this resolution.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? Council members. I want to.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember her, for your comments. I support the human right to privacy and will be voting yes on this resolution to affirm that. I think we should also follow up on this resolution by taking concrete steps to actually protect the privacy of Seattleites.
Speaker 2: A couple of times a year, the council votes on supplemental budgets that accept federal money from the Department of Homeland Security and to fund so-called fusion centers in Seattle. According to new documents leaked by Edward Snowden. These fusion centers are used just to help the NSA spy on every man, woman and child in Seattle and in the
Speaker 2: country. So I will vote yes on this resolution, and I will encourage my colleagues to join me in putting this resolution into practice and voting against funding the fusion centers. The next supplemental budget. Thank you.

Speaker 0: Thank you. I move to pass Council Bill 120329. Is there a second? Second, Councilor Peterson. And this is your bill. The floor is yours.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Council president, colleagues, all three utility bills, utility relief bills here co-sponsoring Councilmember Nelson. This one happens to deal with Seattle Public Utilities specifically. It does the same thing for our emergency assistance program as the city bill we just adopted a moment ago.
Speaker 1: As with its companion bill, this council bill 120329 simply extends an existing utility relief policy. Extending this release through 2023 will become even more important for customers of Seattle Public Utilities, because the King County Executive and King County Council members are currently considering a substantial increase in wastewater treatment fees.
Speaker 1: King County passes their wastewater treatment fees, which comprise nearly 50% of households, as few bills directly to our Seattle customers. So the more relief we can provide to lower income at SPU customers, the better. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Councilor Peterson. And I should have noted that I actually had it noted here in the margins that these are the items two, three and four are Councilmember Peterson and Councilmember Nelson. So thank you. Are there any comments for Councilmember Peterson?
Speaker 0: A cast member must get up.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much. I just want to take this opportunity to thank Councilmember Peterson for the joint work that we are looking into with the public utilities folks about how to make sure that more of the people who are qualifying for the utility discount program get automatically enrolled.
Speaker 2: And that that's something that I had looked into in 2018 and 2019. And I think with the continued efforts to extend additional support, but also the concern on the horizon that many of these supportive programs are going to sunset, having automatic enrollment and things like utility, discount program and other strategies to support working families.
Speaker 2: It's going to be really critical. So I really appreciate you taking the reins on that, Councilmember Peterson, and your quick action to respond to some of those ideas and look forward to continuing to engage with you on some longer term policy solutions.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Casper.
Speaker 0: Hey. We all done.
Speaker 1: You council president asked. Okay, great.

"<document> Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy (above) in the head . Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday night and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy in the head, leaving him critically injured. The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey. According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation. The father then ran into the boy's bedroom to shield him as the gunman followed shooting, authorities said. Ammunition plowed through the wall and the bedroom door, although it was unclear which bullets struck the boy. The lath and plaster of the wall are believed to have slowed the shots. The boy was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he underwent surgery for a head wound. As of Monday, he was listed in critical but stable condition. His great-aunt confirmed to NBC LA that his condition was continuing to improve. 'I know that at some point he did say something. They said he was going to be OK,' she said. No other family members were injured in the incident. The young victim's mother and 17-year-old brother were also reported to be in the bedroom,  while the boy's grandmother was in another room. Apparently the front door and security gate had been left open as the father had been expecting his 20-year-old son to return. Scene of the crime: The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey . Unprovoked: According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation . Shootings are rare in the residential neighborhood, police said. Indeed, neighbors told CBS News that the family has lived in the residence for more than a decade with no problem. 'According to the family, they did not recognize the suspect' and there was nothing in the house that indicated drugs or other illegal activity, Los Angeles Police Capt. Nicole Alberca said at a news conference Monday afternoon. The names of the family members have been withheld but a photo of the boy has been released. The image shows him smiling with long, wavy, golden-brown hair down to his shoulders. Although the gunman is believed to have fled on foot, anyone who may have seen a vehicle leaving the area is urged to call Los Angeles Regional Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS. </document> <Summary> Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy in the head, leaving him critically injured.

"<document> Are Native calls for Black solidarity simply expedient in a situation of settler colonialism? My sense is that there is something more complicated, and concerning, at work. If one surveys the writing on Black-Native solidarity in the field of Native studies, one finds frequent reference to histories of shared struggle, strategic alliance, and cohabitation in place of or alongside acknowledgment of histories of Indian slavery, ongoing exclusion of Black Native people, and pervasive anti-Black racism. In drawing up the historical balance sheet this way, scholars suggest there is ground for Black-Native solidarity in the present. Even where there is no denial or minimization of the history of Indian slavery, even where Native anti-Black racism is recognized and the struggles of Black Native people are affirmed, an argument is forwarded that solidarity in this moment can be retrieved from the past and refashioned for the future. In this sense, Native peoples are seeking to reunite with lost allies, namely, those enslaved Africans from the early colonial period who demonstrated “a spiritual worldview, land-informed practices, and were held together by kinship structures which created relationships that allocated every one a role in the community” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). This is political solidarity derived from “cultural similarities.” The implications of this claim are considerable. If Black-Native solidarity is founded upon shared Indigenous worldviews, practices, and kinship structures, then the prerequisite for Black people to move, politically and ethically, from settlers to allies “in the interest of a deeper solidarity” with Native people is, in a word, re-indigenization. In so doing, Black people on the North American scene not only become politically relevant to settler decolonization but also, en route, redress “the true horror of slavery”— the loss of culture: “Diasporic Black struggles, with some exceptions, do not tend to lament the loss of Indigeneity and the trauma of being ripped away from the land that defines their very identities. From Indigenous perspectives, the true horror of slavery was that it has created generations of ‘de-culturalized’ Africans, denied knowledge of language, clan, family, and land base, denied even knowledge of who their nations are” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). From Indigenous perspectives, diasporic Black struggles would, first and foremost, need to lament the loss of indigeneity that slavery entails, a process that requires acknowledging that the loss is both historic and ongoing. This would be a more proper posttraumatic response than “internalizing colonial concepts of how peoples relate to land, resources, and wealth” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). However, what becomes curious upon even the briefest reflection is the fact that “denied knowledge of language, clan, family, and land base”— and the consequent temptation toward “internalizing colonial concepts”—is precisely what Native re sis tance and resurgence is struggling against to this day. To wit: “I believe that the systematic disconnection (and dispossession) of Indigenous Peoples from our homelands is the defining characteristic of colonization” (Waziyatawin 2012, 72). So, deculturalization, or loss of indigeneity, is a general condition of Black and Native peoples, not one that Native people can restrict to Black people in order to offer (or withhold) sympathies. The structuring difference between settler colonization and enslavement is to be found precisely in the latter’s denial of “knowledge of who their nations are”— that is, deracination. On this count, the loss of indigeneity for Native peoples can be named and its recovery pursued, and that pursuit can (and must) become central to political mobilization. The loss of indigeneity for Black peoples can be acknowledged only abstractly and its recovery is lost to history, and so something else must (and can) become central to political mobilization. Not the dialectics of loss and recovery but rather the loss of the dialectics of loss and recovery as such, a politics with no (final) recourse to foundations of any sort, a politics forged from critical resources immanent to the situation, resources from anywhere and anyone, which is to say from nowhere and no one in particular. From Indigenous perspectives, this baseless politics can only ever be a liability. Without a base, which is to say a land base, a politics of resistance can only succumb to “civilization’s fallacies and destructive habits.” The quest for equality is perhaps the most pernicious of those fallacies. The conclusion of this line of thinking is that, due to “the trauma of being ripped away from the land that defines their very identities,” landless Black people in diaspora cannot mount genuine resistance to the settler colonial state and society; they can only be held apart from it as slaves. Which is to say that, without the benefits of a land base and absent the constitutive exclusion of slavery, Blacks are destined to become white, and thus settlers, in thought and action; moreover, they have effectively become so postemancipation.10 But rather than argue that Black people in North America do, in fact, have significant, if attenuated, Indigenous worldviews, practices, and kinship structures or, in any case, can learn such from others in order to begin fighting the good fight; I submit we must consider the possibility that (1) the “Black Diasporic struggles” under examination are irreducible to antiracism, (2) that antiracism is irreducible to demands upon the state, and (3) that demands upon the state are irreducible to statist politics.11 Blacks need not be Indigenous or enslaved Africans, or a mix of the two, in order to be allies to Native peoples in the Amer i cas, what ever that might mean. And I say all of this without a need to mention the “notable exceptions” other wise known as the Black radical tradition.12 What if there are, and will have always been, ways to pursue settler decolonization other wise than as Indigenous peoples and their immigrant allies, a movement from within slavery whose abolition is yet to come? </document> <Summary> Native calls for Black solidarity in a situation of settler colonialism are not simply expedient, but rather something more complicated and concerning.
In the field of Native studies, there is frequent reference to histories of shared struggle, strategic alliance, and cohabitation, alongside acknowledgment of histories of Indian slavery, ongoing exclusion of Black Native people, and pervasive anti-Black racism.
Despite these complex histories, scholars suggest there is ground for Black-Native solidarity in the present. </Summary>"

"<document> Wellness warrior Belle Gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell-all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis. The 23-year-old founder of The Whole Pantry app came clean about her circumstances, telling the Australian Women's Weekly, 'none of it's true'. In the interview, Gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only 'human'. Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders. Scroll down for video . Life-long struggle with the truth: Belle Gibson sensationally admitted that her terminal cancer was a lie in an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly . Lamble has not treated Gibson personally but said, in her professional opinion, she believes Gibson could be displaying signs of both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities, Lamble says. 'A lack of remorse definitely fits in. It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. 'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.' While other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. Changing times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble . 'With Munchhausen, they normally don’t just lie, they go much further to be sick. 'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don’t normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said. 'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, ""what’s wrong with me?'' 'So I think in this particular case,  she’s made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble. Another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic. 'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder . 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said. Lamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example. According to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... 1. They deceive and lie . 2. They lack remorse . 3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible . 4. They don’t respect the law . 5. They don’t mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived . 6. They are very charming and charismatic . 7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in . 8. They show a real interest in people . 9. Passionate about things . 'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble. 'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand. 'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said. 'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' Lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading. 'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything. 'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy. 'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why.

'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. 'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.' According to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her. </document> <Summary> Wellness warrior Belle Gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell-all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis.
The 23-year-old founder of The Whole Pantry app came clean about her circumstances, telling the Australian Women's Weekly, 'none of it's true'.
In the interview, Gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only 'human'.
Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders. </Summary>"

"<document> First,  America's mature political institutions organized around the rule of law have made it a relatively predictable and cooperative hegemon. The pluralistic and regularized way in which U.S. foreign and security policy is made reduces surprises and allows other states to build long-term, mutually beneficial relations. The governmental separation of powers creates a shared decision-making system that opens up the process and reduces the ability of any one leader to make abrupt or aggressive moves toward other states. An active press and competitive party system also provide a service to outside states by generating information about U.S. policy and determining its seriousness of purpose. The messiness of a democracy can, indeed, frustrate American diplomats and confuse foreign observers. But over the long term, democratic institutions produce more consistent and credible policies--policies that do not reflect the capricious and idiosyncratic whims of an autocrat. Think of the United States as a giant corporation that seeks foreign investors. It is more likely to attract investors if it can demonstrate that it operates according to accepted accounting and fiduciary principles. The rule of law and the institutions of policymaking in a democracy are the political equivalent of corporate transparency and accountability. Sharp shifts in policy must ultimately be vetted within the policy process and pass muster by an array of investigatory and decision-making bodies.  Because it is a constitutional, rule-based democracy, outside states are more willing to work with the United States-or, to return to the corporate metaphor, to invest in ongoing partnerships. </document> <Summary> America's mature political institutions organized around the rule of law have made it a relatively predictable and cooperative hegemon.

"<document> Twelve months ago, Liverpool were a free-flowing, potent attacking force with the SS (Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of Liverpool's 101 goals in the Premier League.This season, however, the goals have dried up. Replacing Suarez was always going to be a near-impossible task, but Liverpool fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the Uruguayan's absence. Unfortunately for Brendan Rodgers, things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (right) scored 52 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season . Raheem Sterling has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only scored six Premier League goals . Jordan Henderson (centre) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season, a penalty against Arsenal on Saturday . With just seven games of the season left Liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard - have scored six goals each. To put that into context, only Crystal Palace (Dwight Gayle and Mile Jedinak - four) and Sunderland (Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher - four) have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool. while Aston Villa's top scorers Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor have also only managed six each. What the stats clearly show is that Liverpool have not filled the void left by Suarez, they are missing a Harry Kane (19 goals), a Diego Costa (also 19), a Sergio Aguero (17), even a Charlie Austin (16 goals) - and it has cost them dearly. Harry Kane (centre) didn't score against Burnley on Sunday, but has 19 Premier League goals this season . Diego Costa is the joint top scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals in his first season in England . Liverpool fans would argue that in Sturridge, who scored 21 league goals last term, they do have a player capable of scoring 20+ goals a season - and they are right. The England striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries, and that is unfortunate, but Liverpool's others goal threats - Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - simply haven't met the standards set by the SS last season. Some may also argue that while Liverpool lack a single focal point in attack, the group as a whole have picked up the slack. That may be true to an extent but Kane and Costa have scored more than Sterling, Henderson and Gerrard combined. And there can be little doubt that had Sturridge remained fit all season he would have more than six Premier League goals by this stage of the season. The are mitigating circumstances for Liverpool, no doubt, but the stats don't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by Suarez or Sturridge has proven costly for Liverpool - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on Champions League football next season. Only Sunderland and Crystal Palace have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool this season. ARSENAL - Alexis Sánchez, Olivier Giroud. 14.

Robinson was 38 weeks pregnant when she says she was struck at least three times in her back at her parents' home .

Her parents' home surveillance system records in intervals - it captured about 30 seconds of the confrontation. Robinson, 38, is cornered and there are two officers behind her - she is not clearly visible, but is near the kitchen counter. In the video, which was posted to Facebook and YouTube, Robinson can be heard screaming 'Let go, you know I'm pregnant.' But then one of the officers appears to hit her with his fist and his arm raises again. The camera cuts off, but Robinson, who received the Air Force's highest honor, the Airman's Medal, after helping drag several soldiers from a burning plane in Iraq, insists he struck her about three of four more times.

She says CPS were called as she and her husband - with who she says she has a rocky relationship -  had an argument at their home. She says she went to her parent's home with her toddler son, but her stepson, who has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair, told his teacher about the incident -  who in turn reported it to CPS. On March 3, CPS investigators removed her three stepchildren - ranging in age from six to nine - from their home. Then Robinson received a call from a CPS investigator telling her that he wanted to talk to her about the incident as well as check up on her toddler son. But she says when they arrived, they told her they were they to take her son. She says she stepped in front of her son as she tried to close the door and put her hands up as she screamed 'No, you're not touching my kid.'

"<document> Speaker 3: Agenda item for Council Goal 119803 requiring that certain uniformed peace officers do not cover with a mourning band the serial number that is engraved on their badge and section 3.28. 130. The code declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date.
Speaker 3: All might be forced out of the city council.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. I will move to pass Council Bill 119803. Is there a second?
Speaker 2: Thank.
Speaker 0: It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of this bill, so I am going to recognize you in order to address this item.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much. So today we're voting on Council Bill 11 9803, which will require officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers on a different part of the badge. Many, many constituents have contacted the council, alarmed that batch numbers were not visible in the two weeks following the murder
Speaker 1: of George Floyd. After I announced that I was drafting legislation, Chief Bass issued a directive to all officers to display their badge numbers while wearing mourning bands. I, of course, appreciate that order, but believe that this policy must be adopted into state city law.
Speaker 1: The legislation amends Section 3.28130 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was created after the 1999 WTO protests, when people noted at that time that they could not view the nametags of officers. So then former City Council member Peter Steinberg sponsored legislation to create a new section of the municipal code to require display of nametag.
Speaker 1: This legislation is emergency legislation. So it will go into effect immediately upon signature of the mayor within the next ten days. It would not have the additional 30 day waiting period for non-emergency legislation. The bill also requests that the Seattle Police Department work with all other law enforcement agencies whose police officers reasonably may be anticipated to enforce
Speaker 1: traffic or criminal laws in Seattle pursuant to Chapter ten point. Our CW to develop a policy that would require these peace officers when enforcing these laws to conform with requirements concerning badges, ID devices, departmental ID on uniforms and oral ID that is consistent with Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.28.130.
Speaker 1: The Seattle Police Department is required by Seattle City Council with a proposal for the policy by January 2021. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for that description and for introducing this important bill. Are there any comments or questions on this bill? Hey, I'm not hearing or seeing any. Again, I want to thank you, Councilmember Herbold. I think we have all discussed this bill quite a bit before today and do agree with the approach that you've described, which
Speaker 0: is which is about not just allowing this kind of policy to exist at the discretion of whomever might be the chief, but to actually make sure that this is made concrete and long lasting through through legislation. And, of course, a future council could disagree with their policy position and change that.
Speaker 0: But I think it's pretty clear that this council agrees very strongly that this should be the policy and that it should be codified in law and not just exist in a in a in a police manual or in a directive from from the chief.
Speaker 0: So appreciate the wisdom in nonetheless moving forward this legislation and appreciate you bringing this for our consideration. Because remember state I see that you raise your hand, please.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Council member Herbold, thank you for bringing forward this legislation. I just wanted to ask you a question, both as a sponsor of this legislation and as chair of public safety. We know that even after the chief issued that directive, we heard reports of individuals who are still recovering batch numbers.
Speaker 1: Can you remind folks what to do if they see that happen after this ordinance has passed and.
Speaker 0: What the process should be?
Speaker 1: It would be a violation of both MPD policy and city law. The Office of Professional Accountability has a a complaint process to investigate complaints of violation of city policy. And there's also the ability of an investigation, of the violation of city law to to go along the investigation of the violation of city city policy.
Speaker 1: I do want to note that batch numbers are in different places on different people's badges. Sometimes they're in the center and sometimes they're at the bottom. And I know that some of the examples of covered badge numbers that I saw after Chief Best's order had badges, had the had the tape through the middle, and there was actually
Speaker 1: a badge number at the bottom of the badge. And in some instances, I, of course, have not seen every example of every complaint. There are the this issue is is one of the sort of the the top ten issues that the Office of Professional Accountability is looking at as it relates specifically to the volume of complaints that
Speaker 1: they've received.
Speaker 0: Thank you. And either questions or comments. All right. Hearing that, I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 2: Peterson I.
Speaker 1: Want.
Speaker 2: Strauss i.
Speaker 1: Herbold i.
Speaker 0: Whereas.
Speaker 3: Hi.
Speaker 1: Lewis. Hi. We're Alice. I let's get a. Mosquito. I President Gonzalez. Hi. Nine in favor and unopposed.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much. The bill passes and the chair will sign it and I ask that the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation. Okay, folks, we are now in the other business category of city council. I know of our agenda.
 </document> <Summary> So today we're voting on Council Bill 11 9803, which will require officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers on a different part of the badge.

"<document> One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated. </document> <Summary> US actions do not seem to have contributed much.

Speaker 7: Thank you, Madam President. As you know, I have stated my concerns about the use of on call contracts among members agencies a number of times. I believe that the practice of setting aside money for certain vendors without any additional information or reporting requirements to City Council regarding the scope of the work being done subverts the intent of
Speaker 7: our Charter. Council has been explicitly given the authority to approve contracts over $500,000, and this practice doesn't provide transparency or accountability, which I believe my residents expect from their government, although DOT has changed their practices around on call in response to these concerns.

"<document> Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported. The 55-year-old newsman is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he looks to return to his post on NBC Nightly News, according to a source close to the network. It comes after it was revealed that an internal inquiry found Williams's had lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams (pictured) has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported . He was suspended in February with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. A source said to be close to NBC has told The New York Post how Williams 'is saying he’s not going down without a fight and (is) threatening to make it really ugly'. Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends. Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade . Yesterday it was reported that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role. But this contradicted earlier claims that NBC executives wanted Williams out and were trying to negotiate his resignation. A source told the New York Daily News 'Andy (Lack) believes viewers want him (Williams) back. 'The feeling is that (Williams') problem seems to be more with the media and other reporters than his viewers - if Andy can figure out a way to get him back on the air he will do it.' The source added that Lack 'will not make a decision about Williams' fate until the network's internal probe is complete.' On Tuesday, a report emerged in the Hollywood Reporter that Lack was in fact not convinced that Williams would be able to return. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. He is reported to have signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year. According to the New York Post, NBC News has yet to make any decision's about the newsman's future. </document> <Summary> Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported.

"<document> It is open season for partisan gerrymandering after the Supreme Court in Rucho v. Common Cause ruled in a 5-4 decision that partisan gerrymandering was a non-justiciable “political question.” Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484, 204 L.Ed.2d 931 (2019). The Court dealt with two consolidated cases involving voters and other plaintiffs from North Carolina and Maryland alleging that both states’ congressional districting maps were unconstitutionally gerrymandered based on partisan lines. In North Carolina the plaintiffs claimed that the state’s districting plan diluted the votes of Democrats, and in Maryland the plaintiffs claimed that the state’s districting plan diluted the votes of Republicans. There was no question that both states’ legislatures engaged in the practice of partisan gerrymandering. As one of the two Republicans chairing the redistricting committee stated, “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So, I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.” Rucho v. Common Cause, 318 F. Supp. 3d 777, 809 (MDNC 2018). The same Republican also stated that the map was drawn with the aim of electing ten Republicans and three Democrats because he did “not believe it [would be] possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 3 Democrats.” Id. at 808. Despite the fact that Democratic candidates received more votes statewide, nine Republicans and three Democrats were elected with one election still pending. Rucho, 139 S. Ct. 2491-92. Similarly, the Democratic governor of Maryland testified that his aim was to “use the redistricting process to change the overall composition of Maryland’s congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican by flipping” one district. Id. The plaintiffs alleged that the partisan gerrymandering violated the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Elections Clause, and article I, §2, of the Constitution.

"<document> Tribal rights to water are firmly established, although for any tribe, claiming such rights is an arduous, lengthy, and expensive process. Still, the model — one that resulted in 32 settlements approved by Congress — has a large role for the tribes and others who rely on a common water resource. If settlement is not achievable in such cases, litigation is always an option, and the tribes (with substantial federal support) have generally done well in such litigation. In the case of environmental habitat protection like that at stake in the DAPL controversy, however, there is no settlement model. Tribal input into most projects affecting tribal lands and water is advisory only. Unlike the water rights situation, where tribes and the federal government are usually allied, tribes dissatisfied with a federal project or permitting decision are left to battle against the United States alone. The DAPL experience shows the shortcomings in this approach and should serve as a springboard for changes in federal law. Tribes should be afforded more influence in federal permitting decisions that will affect tribal land, water and people. It is not enough to be consulted if the permitting agency is free to reject tribal input subject to deferential judicial review. The Supreme Court could fix the problem by limiting its narrow interpretation of the tribal trust to the Tucker Act cases, and requiring that agency actions comply with a substantive trust obligation to recognize and protect tribal interests. And, of course, Congress has paramount authority that it should exercise due to its solemn obligations to Indian nations. </document> <Summary> Tribal rights to water are firmly established, although for any tribe, claiming such rights is an arduous, lengthy, and expensive process.

"<document> A group of Muslim migrants have been arrested for 'aggravated murder' after allegedly throwing 12 Christians into the Mediterranean sea during a recent crossing from Libya, Italian police reports. Witnesses say a fight broke out on a rubber dinghy carrying more than 100 African migrants from Libya to Sicily, after which the men were thrown to their deaths. A group of 15 men have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate,' Palermo police said in a statement. Murders: A fight over religion broke out on a boat carrying 105 migrants from Libya, after which 12 men 'professing the Christian faith' were thrown to their deaths. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians. 'The threats then materialised and 12 people, all Nigerian and Ghanaian, are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean,' the police statement added. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. A group of 15 Muslim men, from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau, have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'  (not pictured) Italian Red Cross operators give first aid to immigrants as they arrive  in the Italian port of Messina  yesterday . This week, Italian coastguards intercepted more than 42 boats attempting to make the crossing to Europe . The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' This followed reports earlier today of a shipwreck feared to have cost 41 lives off the Italian coast. Four men, two Nigerians, a Ghanaian and one from Niger, who had been rescued while floating in the Mediterranean by an Italian Navy helicopter reported the shipwreck once they arrived in the Italian port of Trapani today. They said had left Tripoli in Libya on Saturday and stayed adrift for four days. The new tragedies come just days after aid agencies reported 400 presumed dead in the sinking of another ship near the Libyan coast. The deaths have raised calls for a more robust search and rescue of the seas between Libya and Europe amid a surge in migration between the Middle East and Africa toward Italy. </document> <Summary> A group of Muslim migrants have been arrested for 'aggravated murder' after allegedly throwing 12 Christians into the Mediterranean sea during a recent crossing from Libya, Italian police reports.

Speaker 3: . Thank you for being here, Mayor, for this piece of legislation. Basically, this working group will assess collection of fees and fines for criminal violations and infractions and how and how they impact successful reentry into our communities. The work we'll be doing will identify areas where the city's efforts could be strengthened by more effective coordination with other criminal
Speaker 3: justice agencies and develop a set of additional policies and ordinances and strategies to help us implement and facilitate prisoner reentry. This resolution is asking city departments to explore the creation of a Certificate of Restoration of opportunity, otherwise known as a crop.
Speaker 3: And many of you are aware of the work dealing with a crop in the state legislature. And so we will explore that. If the state legislature does not pass one in the upcoming legislative session, it is part of our agenda.
Speaker 3: We are hopeful, but we will be prepared of things in a short session. Do not go the way we want them to. This workgroup will report back to the Council by the end of February 2016 with an initial report, and the final report is due September 1st, 2016.
Speaker 3: Now, why are we doing this? What is this resolution all about? Well, we know in 2015, approximately 2.2 million people were incarcerated nationally, a 500% increase in the last 30 years. We speak at our committee and in our communities about the massive incarceration of many communities locally.
Speaker 3: In 2015, 16,675 adults were incarcerated in Washington State prisons, and a further average of 12,618 people per day were placed in local jails, with 2800 being jailed right here in King County. So in 2014, about 20% of the almost 8000 individuals released from Department of Corrections were released right here in our county.
Speaker 3: People of color are disproportionately represented among those released in King County. A study demonstrated while African-Americans were only 6% of the King County's population, 41% of people released from the Department of Corrections were African-American. And while Latinos were only 6% of King County's population, 18% of those people released from DC were Latinos.
Speaker 3: This work is needed. These policies are needed. This resolution heads us in the right direction as just this work we will be doing. And I personally believe that how cities and counties deal with the reentry of those who have been in custody will determine largely the fate and success of these cities.

"<document> Tens of millions of new jobs can be created around the world in the next two decades if green policies are put in place to switch the high-carbon economy to low-carbon, the UN has said. Between 15 million and 60 million additional jobs are likely, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). These are net gains in employment for the world economy, taking into account any job losses in high-carbon industries that fail to transform. Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP, said: ""The findings underline that [the green economy] can include millions more people in terms of overcoming poverty and delivering improved livelihoods for this and future generations. It is a positive message of opportunity in a troubled world of challenges."" As well as generating net new gains in the number of jobs, the switch to a green economy could help to lift millions of people out of poverty. In the US, there are now about three million green jobs, in sectors such as wind power and energy efficiency, the study found. In the UK, the number is close to one million and has been one of the few areas of the economy that has been creating jobs. There are about 500,000 people working in green jobs in Spain. In the developing world, too, the number is growing rapidly—about 7 percent of people employed in Brazil, amounting to three million people, are now in the green economy. However, realizing the full potential of green jobs depends on countries taking action to develop the green economy and bringing in policies that will foster investment, according to the report. Juan Somavia, director general of the International Labour Organisation, which was co-author of the report, said: ""The current development model has proven to be inefficient and unsustainable, not only for the environment, but for economies and societies as well. We urgently need to move to a sustainable development path with a coherent set of policies, with people and the planet at the center."" He rebuffed claims that greening industry would lead to job losses, because of the changes to some traditional industries such as fossil fuel extraction. He said: ""Environmental sustainability is not a job killer, as it is sometimes claimed. On the contrary, if properly managed, it can lead to more and better jobs, poverty reduction and social inclusion. Some areas are more vulnerable to losses—global fishing fleets, for instance, will probably have to be reduced if overfishing is to be tackled, and fishermen will have to be found new employment. But the report found that long-term sustainable management could avoid job losses. For instance, an estimated one million people in Asia may have lost jobs in forestry because of poor resource management, which could have been largely avoided with better policies and enforcement. Jobs easily identified as ""green""—workers in renewable energy, for instance, maintaining forests or installing insulation—are not the only ones to be touched by the shift to a more environmentally sustainable economy. At least half of the global workforce will be affected in some way by 2030, the study found. This will stretch from people whose industrial processes are overhauled to cut greenhouse gases, to farmers who change their methods to be more environmentally friendly, and workers in the construction industry who begin to install new greener materials. Some of the sectors identified in the report as being most affected by the changes include agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource-intensive manufacturing, recycling, building and transport. Women could benefit—if the shift is managed properly it could provide them with better access to jobs and higher incomes. The study, ""Working Towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for Decent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy,"" has been timed to be published ahead of World Environment Day next week, and to inform discussions at the landmark Rio+20 environmental conference, where nations will attempt to work on a new set of targets and agreements to help halt environmental degradation around the world. </document> <Summary>  Tens of millions of new jobs can be created around the world in the next two decades if green policies are put in place to switch the high-carbon economy to low-carbon, the UN has said.
The findings underline that [the green economy] can include millions more people in terms of overcoming poverty and delivering improved livelihoods for this and future generations. It is a positive message of opportunity in a troubled world of challenges. 
The current development model has proven to be inefficient and unsustainable, not only for the environment, but for economies and societies as well. We urgently need to move to a sustainable development path with a coherent set of policies, with people and the planet at the center.
Environmental sustainability is not a job killer, as it is sometimes claimed. On the contrary, if properly managed, it can lead to more and better jobs, poverty reduction and social inclusion.

"<document> Talk about gobby! This little fellow has been born with FIVE mouths - believed to be the most ever seen on a calf. The strange-looking baby opens all ten lips when he is sucking at his mother's udders. But he can only take in milk through two of his mouths. He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving. But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009. Last month a bull with two faces - one on top the other - was sold to an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. The 440kg animal fetched around £300 in the auction at Mareeba Livestock Yard. Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago . Tired out: Both her mouths sucked at the same time because they were operated by a single brain . </document> <Summary> This little fellow has been born with FIVE mouths - believed to be the most ever seen on a calf.

"<document> FIFA presidential candidate Luis Figo on Wednesday disputed the Confederation of African Football's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent Sepp Blatter in the presidential elections next month. The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Sportsmail he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. 'I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation,' said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder. Luis Figo does not believe that Sepp Blatter will receive ALL 54 votes from African nations . Blatter (left) has received the backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) 'Even when he (Hayatou) announced he would support Blatter, we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation.

"<document> Heidegger's work is a call to reflect, to think in some way other than calculatively, technologically, pragmatically. Once we begin to move with and into Heidegger's call and begin to see our trying to seize control and solve problems as itself a problematic approach, if we still believe that thinking's only real purpose is to function as a prelude to action, in attempting to think we will only twist within the agonizing grip of paradox, feeling pure frustration, unable to conceive of ourselves as anything but paralysed. However, as so many peoples before us have known, paradox is not only a trap; it is also a scattering point and a passageway. Paradox invites examination of its own constitution (hence of the patterns of thinking within which it occurs) and thereby breaks a way of thinking open, revealing the configurations of power that propel it and hold it on track. And thus it sometimes makes possible the dissipation of that power and the deflection of thinking into new paths and new possibilities. If we read him seriously and listen genuinely, Heidegger frustrates us. At a time when the stakes are so very high and decisive action is so loudly and urgently called for, when the ice caps are melting and the bird flu is spreading and the president is selling off our national wilderness reserves to private contractors for quick private gain, Heidegger apparently calls us to do - nothing. When things that matter so much are hanging in the balance, this frustration quickly turns to anger and disgust and even furor. How dare this man, who might legitimately be accused of having done nothing right himself at a crucial time in his own nation's history, elevate quietism to a philosophical principle? Responsible people have to act, surely, and to suggest anything else is to side with the forces of destruction and short-sighted greed. If we get beyond the revulsion and anger that Heidegger's call may initially inspire and actually examine the feasibility of response, we may move past the mere frustration of our moral desires and begin to undergo frustration of another kind, the philosophical frustration that is attendant on paradox. How is it possible, we ask, to choose, to will, to do nothing? Heidegger is not consecrating quietism. His call places in question the bimodal logic of activity and passivity; it points out the paradoxical nature of our passion for action, our passion for maintaining control. What is the origin of that drive? Is that drive itself really un- der our control? Is it something we choose and will, or it is something whose origins and meanings transcend us? The call itself suggests that our drive for acting decisively and forcefully is part of what must be thought through, that the narrow option of will versus surrender is one of the power configurations of current thinking that must be allowed to dissipate </document> <Summary> Paradox is not only a trap, it is also a scattering point and a passageway.

"<document> Researchers at Oxford University have produced the first list of global risks ‘that pose a threat to human civilisation, or even possibly to all human life.’ The report focuses on risks with ‘impacts that for all practical purposes can be called infinite’. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on it. And while human extinction might be a horrific, accidental side effect of climate change, a metorite impact or a super volcano, the report warns that AI might decide to cause our extinction deliberately (my emphasis): ...extreme intelligences could not easily be controlled (either by the groups creating them, or by some international regulatory regime), and would probably act to boost their own intelligence and acquire maximal resources for almost all initial AI motivations. And if these motivations do not detail the survival and value of humanity, the intelligence will be driven to construct a world without humans. This makes extremely intelligent AIs a unique risk, in that extinction is more likely than lesser impacts. AI is included, along with nanotechnology and synthetic biology, in a category of emerging risks. The emerging risks are poorly understood but also have the potential to solve many of the other problems on the list. The threat of AI comes from its potential to run away from us – it’s just possible that AI will end up working on itself and evolve beyond our understanding and control. At which point we’d better hope it likes us. Oxford University isn’t the first to draw attention to the potential threat posed by super-intelligent computers. Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, has warned about the dangers of AI repeatedly. Musk has described it as ‘our biggest existential threat‘ and taken on investments in AI companies just so that he can keep a close eye on what’s going on. Speaking to students at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) he likened it to a demon that, once summoned, won’t be controllable: With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it’s like - yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon. Doesn’t work out Bill Gates backed up Musk’s concerns during an ‘ask me anything’ session on Reddit: First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned. If two of history’s most successful technology entrepreneurs aren’t persuasive enough for you, how about the man they call The Greatest Living Physicist? Stephen Hawking, whose speech synthesiser uses a basic form of AI, isn’t a man with a lot of words to spare and when he spoke to the BBC about AI he was characteristically terse: The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded. Musk and Hawking are also two names among a veritable who’s who of AI luminaries who recently signed an open letter calling for research priorities focused on maximising the societal benefit of AI. What all these very intelligent people are reflecting is that we simply can’t predict how AI is going to develop, not least because AI might be a key tool in the development of AI. Perhaps the only sensible place to start then is to figure out a way of keeping a close eye on just exactly what is going on. Musk has his investments but computer scientist Eric Horvitz is thinking bigger. Horvitz has teamed up with Russ Altman, a professor of bioengineering and computer science at Stanford, to create AI100 – a 100-year study into Artificial Intelligence. Horvitz and Altman will join five others on a committee that will commission studies into how developments in AI will affects all aspects of human life over a number of generations. The committee members will obviously change over time but the committee itself, and the host, are planning to stick around and keep a close eye on things. If your goal is to create a process that looks ahead 30 to 50 to 70 years, it's not altogether clear what artificial intelligence will mean, or how you would study it ... But it's a pretty good bet that Stanford will be around One of the many things that AI100 will look at is the loss of control of AI systems and whether or not that could give rise to the kind of dystopic outcomes that the Oxford University researchers are trying to focus attention on. I can’t help wondering though; if we could look 100 years into the future and witness the final meeting of the AI100 committee, will anyone on it be human? </document> <Summary> Researchers at Oxford University have produced the first list of global risks ‘that pose a threat to human civilisation, or even possibly to all human life.’

"<document> The results of the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment¶ ¶ (MEA), as well as other global and regional assessments of the¶ ¶ marine environment, recognize that biodiversity in the world’s oceans and coastal areas continue to decline. Last year, a group of leading scientists concluded in Science that, ‘‘the loss of marine biodiversity is increasingly impairing the ocean’s ability to produce seafood, resist diseases, ﬁlter pollutants, maintain water quality and recover from perturbations such as over-ﬁshing and climate change’’¶ ¶ [6]. The MEA recognizes that people are at the center of this evolution. Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period in human history [7].¶ ¶ Rapid population growth, technological change and improvement, and growing consumer demands, have all considerably¶ ¶ increased the need for more food, more energy and more trade.¶ ¶ Because of limited or diminishing resources on land, an increasing larger share of goods and services needs to come from coastal and marine areas. Resource extraction is expanding progressively into¶ ¶ deeper waters and further offshore [8]. Aquaculture, offshore¶ ¶ energy, maritime transport and tourism are all facing increasingly¶ ¶ ﬂourishing and prosperous times in coming years. Future outlooks for offshore activities conﬁrm that this trend will continue, and¶ ¶ even more likely accelerate, in the next decades.1¶ ¶ All these activities have already considerably increased the demand for ocean space, and will continue to do so in the future.¶ ¶ In some parts of the world, combined demands for human use of ocean space have exceeded about three times the available space [9,10]. Because of overlapping objectives, not all uses are compatible with one another and are competing for ocean space or have adverse effects on each other (user– user conﬂicts, e.g., oil and gas development and ﬁsheries) [11]. A comprehensive study on the¶ ¶ interactions among users completed for the Belgian Part of the¶ ¶ North Sea classiﬁed conﬂicts among users from ‘‘manageable in¶ ¶ time, space and overlap’’ to ‘‘mutual exclusion.’’ A visualization of¶ ¶ this user–user interaction shows clearly that conﬂicts or negative¶ ¶ impacts among users far outreach their positive interactions¶ ¶ (Fig. 1) [12].¶ ¶ However, conﬂicts among users and the development of¶ ¶ offshore economic activities are not the only pressing issue in¶ ¶ the oceans. The biggest concern today is the impact of all these activities on the marine environment or, in other words, the conﬂicts between human use and the marine environment (user– environment conﬂicts). With resources being limited both in space and amount, economic development has proven to be devastating for many places and resources, elevating competition¶ ¶ among users and interest groups and resulting in increasingly¶ ¶ undesirable effects, including over-ﬁshing, loss and destruction of habitat, pollution, climate change, and the cumulative threats to the health of the oceans as a whole.¶ ¶ Also, irrespective of the existence of conﬂicts and human¶ ¶ impacts, marine ecosystems have an inherent need to function¶ ¶ sustainably. The same can be said from an economic perspective.¶ ¶ Offshore economic sectors, to continue their existence and remain¶ ¶ economically viable, have to develop and function sustainably¶ ¶ as well.¶ ¶ The multiple objectives related to achieving economic and environmental sustainability, and the need to minimize and reduce conﬂicts of both types (user– user and user– environment¶ ¶ conﬂicts) can only be dealt with through an integrated approach to management. This is nothing new. In the late 1930s, an¶ ¶ integrated, multiple objective approach was ﬁrst introduced in¶ ¶ water resource management in the United States. Highly inﬂuenced by system analysis concepts (management of complex¶ systems, e.g., the lunar landing program) of the late 1950s and the¶ environmental movements of the 1960s and early 1970s, it was¶ further deepened in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone¶ Management (ICZM, or alternatively Integrated Coastal and Marine¶ Area Management (IMCAM)) during the 1980s–1990s. Since the¶ late 1970s, the scientiﬁc community has increasingly drawn the¶ attention to the problems in the oceans—from biodiversity losses¶ and transformed food webs to marine pollution and warming¶ waters—and has sought for ways to preserve certain areas for¶ their ecological value.2 Especially during the last decade, many of¶ these evolving trends and disciplines have merged together,¶ evoking a new paradigm shift toward an ecosystem-based approach to sea use management, built on the recognition that ‘‘the nature of nature itself is integrated [13].’’¶ Many scientists have advocated reforms centered on the idea¶ of ecosystem-based, sea use management. To date, however, a¶ feasible method for translating this attractive concept into¶ operational management practice has not emerged [4]. Concepts¶ regarding both integrated and ecosystem-based management¶ are often too broad, too abstract and too complex for resource¶ managers to enable effective implementation [14]. One way to achieve a better and more effective implementation of ecosystem-based management in the marine environment is through the use of MSP. </document> <Summary> The results of the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), as well as other global and regional assessments of the marine environment, recognize that biodiversity in the world’s oceans and coastal areas continue to decline.

Speaker 3: Thank you. The Observer Bill of Rights passed out of Committee four zero week before last, and I introduced it. We heard it first, last in August, and there was a lot of work that needed to be done between our first hearing of the bill and our committee vote a week before last.
Speaker 3: But in a nutshell, the bill was introduced in recognition that observation of police activity has always been an important element of police accountability. Here in Seattle, Mothers for Account Mothers for Accountability has for decades trained community observers to watch the actions of police in detaining suspects.
Speaker 3: The majority of police interactions with the public are fair and professional, but the observation of police actions is just one way to reduce the chances that people are treated unfairly in their interactions with police. And, you know, when people are not treated fairly or force is used inappropriately, observation ensures that there's a witness today.
Speaker 3: Actual recording of observed police activity is an element of accountability that is growing in importance. The bill itself would establish that by law, the public has the right to observe police activity consistent with existing police department policy. It states that officers may not use physical force to punish or retaliate against observers and must seek to minimize harm
Speaker 3: to bystanders when using less lethal tools like pepper spray or tear gas. In addition, if a person brings a claim the law was violated, the Office of Professional Accountability must be notified. Across the country, recordings of police activity by the police have increased the public's ability to hold police accountable.
Speaker 3: However, sometimes this has led to arrests, which have in turn have generated First Amendment legal challenges to these arrests. Here in Seattle, the auditor in 2008 reviewed police incidents where people were arrested and charged with obstruction only and without any other charge.
Speaker 3: Resulting one third of the cases involved arrests of bystanders, and over half of these were African-American. That that study in 2008 was when I first became interested in this issue subsequently two that the Washington State Supreme Court recognized the First Amendment right of the public to observe and criticize law enforcement in the case of the state of
Speaker 3: Washington versus E.J. in Seattle. In the case Seattle officers had responded to a call about a fight between the complainant, sister and mother. There was a heated verbal exchange between the officers, and.
Speaker 6: E.J. refused to leave the.
Speaker 3: Open doorway of the house and closed the door because he was observing the interaction. He was a 17 year old black man. He was arrested for obstructing a law enforcement officer. Laws like this have been passed in other states, including California, Oregon and Colorado.
Speaker 3: And at a time when we have an increasing reliance on cameras that police officers wear or have in their cars, I believe we need to remind the public that the police activity that they observe is still important. A Washington Post article from March noted that in a shooting of an A in a shooting in Albuquerque, there were
Speaker 3: seven body cameras present. The camera of the police officer who fired the shot. Was it recording three missed the crucial moment and three were either blurred or contained. No record. So in this time of moving towards more reliance on police worn cameras, I think the public statement that the the observations of members of the public in the
Speaker 3: recordings of the members of public are not only important to police accountability, but the rights of individuals engaging in in that activity will be observed.
Speaker 1: By the city of Seattle.

Speaker 0: Item 17 Report from Economic and Property Development. Recommendation to execute an agreement with the County of Los Angeles to receive and expand $650,000 in grant funds to operate a youth jobs program citywide.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Richardson.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I just want to is this this the funding that we use for our summer youth, our jobs?
Speaker 9: Again.
Speaker 6: It is a portion of that. So it's an augmentation to the we are funding that you saw in the previous item. Again, it's an annual allocation that's gone on for several years. This is the highest allocation that we've gotten initially in the city of Long Beach, partially based on the performance in the placements that we've we've achieved
Speaker 6: . It does allow us to extend the programing down from our 18 to 20 4 to 214 year olds. And again, it's direct work experience money. And with this money, it actually allows us to put about an additional 310 Long Beach youth to work each summer.
Speaker 4: And and is this some of the funding? We're, you know, forget all that. But this is this is fantastic. And the Summer Youth Hire is that program is a phenomenal violence prevention program, along with the spirit of everything we've talked about tonight.
Speaker 4: I think the fact that you expand on that program, adding 300 additional positions for youth 14 to 24 is outstanding. I know that we've talked and we've set a goal this summer for 150, hiring 150 North Lombard youth over the course of this summer.
Speaker 4: And so I just want to say, keep up the great work. I'm this is a really tremendously important item, and I'm honored to help you again spend this money.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Gonzalez. Councilwoman Gonzalez.
Speaker 2: Yes. Thanks again, Nick. Again, this is also I know it's annual, but we're expanding it to include, you know, four years younger for our youth, which is great. I just did have one question really is whether we can receive, because I'd like to see how this is performing.
Speaker 2: And what do you think would be the best time to find out to get like a two from four back to the council to evaluate the performance.
Speaker 6: So most of most of the work experience will happen before the end of August. There are some participants whose circumstances will change over the course of the summer, and we're able to carry some of this money forward and carry them forward.
Speaker 6: BULK But the bulk of the expenditure and program activity will occur before the end of the summer. So we would be happy to come back to you with with the TFF in September to let you know where, what the placements were by district, what businesses sponsored our youth, how they performed some of the, some of the performance
Speaker 6: reviews that the employers put forward.
Speaker 2: That's great. I know you get excited about numbers just like I do sometimes. So thank you. Appreciate that. That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Council. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 10: Thank you. And I see a note in the staff report that the average youth will get about 125 hours worth of work. I think that's that's significant and certainly falls in line with the summer months. I see here that this goes into effect July 1st, 2016, 18 through June 20, 2017.
Speaker 10: The question is when will we start ramping up to hire these 300 youth? Have they been hired already in anticipation of this?
Speaker 6: I'm sorry. Actually, as of this afternoon, 92% of those slots are already full. So it's we anticipate the annual allocation. Again, there's there's other funding that serves use. There's certainly always other opportunities through through our work with the private sector or the or the foundation community to bring more money then to serve the youth.
Speaker 6: So so we keep this cycle of applications on, on a rolling basis in our work and to have youth eligible and ready to go when they have the the bulk of their schedule open in the summer.
Speaker 10: Well, thank you. This is great news. And I will be supporting this hardly.

"<document> In the era of Industry 4.0, data flows will become an even more important production factor. But hacker attacks are increasing worldwide and causing ever greater damage. Countermeasures are necessary and must be harmonized at international level. The United States remains the most important player in global cybersecurity. Hacker Attacks Are Causing Ever Greater Damage Owing to global interconnectedness, information-technology attacks do not know national borders. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of attacks registered in Germany have increased eightfold. Further we observe a wide range of threats and challenges. Most recently, hackers hijacked everyday objects like webcams or routers and carried out denial-of-service attacks (DDos). According to Symantec’s Security Threat Report 2018, connected devices are increasingly the target of cyberattacks – with an increase of 600 per cent within a single year. Industrial enterprises are often victims of targeted, scheduled and more complex attacks. Hacker seek prolonged access to the IT infrastructure of a company in order to steal, manipulate or destroy data longitudinally. In doing so, they can cause huge damage. In the case of large companies, the repair of an attack costs an average €800,000. Defence Strategies Must Be Coordinated at the International Level Security in the digitally interconnected world is only possible through cooperation. Effective protection from cyberattacks demands countermeasures that are developed in an international context. Under Germany’s Presidency of the G20 in 2017, cybersecurity was on the agenda for the first time. Moreover, industry takes a stand on the issue within the Business 20 (B20) process as well. The German B20 Presidency urged the G20 to improve cyber risk management by encouraging: the development of a harmonized cybersecurity baseline framework, the development of a concept for a global interoperable information-sharing platform under OECD guidanc, and a process leading to norms for responsible state behavior. Because the level of protection is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, we need worldwide open markets for cybersecurity products and services. Therefore, bilateral and international trade agreements must harmonize international security requirements and standards. With regard to law enforcement, mutual legal assistance treaties are necessary to enforce law in digital space in a timely manner. Moreover, common international standards should be developed for state access to communication and information structures. Furthermore, bilateral statements of intent on outlawing industrial espionage should be rapidly drafted and specified. The United States and the EU Are Important Actors on the International Stage In the digital economy, the United States is the No. 1 global player. The world’s most innovative and competitive IT companies are U.S. based. The United States have thus particular responsibility for cybersecurity policy. Together with the United States, Germany and the EU must make a commitment in bilateral and multilateral agreements to establish a reliable cybersecurity regime. Undermining NATO would send the wrong signal. </document> <Summary> In the era of Industry 4.0, data flows will become an even more important production factor, but hacker attacks are increasing worldwide and causing ever greater damage.

"<document> Santiago Vergini has indicated he may be ready to extend his stay at Sunderland after revealing Premier League survival could trigger the offer of a two-year permanent contract. The 26-year-old Argentinian returned to the Stadium of Light on a season-long loan deal from Costa Rican side Sport Uruguay de Coronado in August last year and has made 35 appearances to date this season. The last of them was a start in Sunday's 1-0 derby victory over Newcastle which provided a huge boost to the club's top-flight survival hopes. Santiago Vergini (left) is keen to stay at Sunderland having played a key role in the Wearside outfit's 1-0 derby win over Newcastle United on Sunday. Above, the Sunderland defender battles with Ayoze Perez for the ball . Vergini celebrates with team-mate Costel Pantilimon at the full-time whistle following the Wear-Tyne derby win . A successful completion of new head coach Dick Advocaat's mission to keep the Black Cats in the Premier League could have significant consequences for Vergini, and he is open to what might come his way. He told the Sunderland Echo: 'In the contract, it is written that if we stay in the Premier League, I can stay here for another two years. I feel very comfortable here, both at the club and outside the club, so I would be very keen to stay. 'The only downside is the climate and the weather, but even that has been good for the last few days! 'It has been very good to play regularly [this season] and I am very happy. I think with time, I have been able to adapt more to the style of play and also to my team-mates. Vergini helped Sunderland keep a clean sheet in the derby win as he makes a slide tackle on Perez . Sunderland initially signed Vergini on loan in January 2014, with the defender making his debut in an FA Cup fourth round clash with Kidderminster where he makes an attempt to tackle Jack Bryne . 'Apart from the struggles we are going through in the league, I have felt very comfortable.' Victory over the Magpies - their first in nine games in all competitions - eased Sunderland into 15th place and three points clear of the relegation zone. However, that could count for little if Advocaat's men fail to build upon it when Crystal Palace head north on Saturday. Vergini said: 'Every win brings with it a lot of confidence and with a derby game, that is even more the case. In our next game, we need to show the same character and the same spirit as we did on Sunday.' </document> <Summary> Santiago Vergini has indicated he may be ready to extend his stay at Sunderland after revealing Premier League survival could trigger the offer of a two-year permanent contract.

"<document> To be a fraudulent person, on the other hand, is to be caught impersonating a human being. There is only one such position in the anti-black world and it belongs to the black. As DuBois once put it, blacks are constructed not as people with problems, but rather as ""a problem people.""20 Slave codes in the southern United States demanded that slaves receive clothing, food, and lodging sufficient to their basic needs. Slaves, although dead to civil rights and responsibilities-social death-are reduced to nothing but the physical body, unprotected against mutilation or torture.21 The functioning of social death is, again, premised on the context itself as anti-black. The post-Emancipation era of the Black Codes, convict leasing, and lynching ensured that blackness meant social death not by virtue of enslavement, but instead as a product of criminality and imprisonment. Blackness remains to this day the essential marker of criminality and deviance.22 Black existence and its signifier ""criminal,"" then, serve a central metaphorical and structural purpose for a white supremacist bourgeois society. In the con temporary debates on immigration, it provides the menacing content for the construct ""criminal"" that gives the anti immigrant position its purchase in main stream society. To put it differently, we as educators cannot effectively undo the racism of anti-immigrant discourse without also challenging the anti-blackness of crime and punishment. In concrete terms, moreover, we need to recall the destruction of the black community base, the deindustrialization of the political economy, dismantling of the welfare state, and the installment of the prison industrial complex. These processes collectively produced a black population available on a massive scale for social transfer to the living death of prison cages. These dislocations and debasements were the conditions of possibility for the political economy that draws immigrants to this country, while at the same time, the institutionalization of the (vanquished) black liberation movement serves as the pre requisite for the very struggles against the exploitation of immigrant labor that have, rightfully, gained momentum today.23 In other words, there would be no immigrant labor to speak of if the black liberation movement had not been systematically destroyed, and, ironically, that very same social movement history would not otherwise be available to other oppressed groups to learn and benefit from. Needless to say, I have not been at all successful in realizing this kind of analysis with my students. In much of its practice, criminology is an exercise in bad faith in that it encourages students to flee a displeasing truth for a more com forting lie. The criminological discourse on immigration is an expression of bad faith as well. My students live this lie in their own ways. Although they know that ""crime"" is far more complex and messy than a simple case of immorality, the fact that the United States has the largest prison population in the world, both in total numbers and per capita, eighty per cent of whom are people of color, and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) holds some 23,000 people in immigration jails on a given day and about 200,000 annually, does not, in any sincere way, trouble them much.24 At some level in their consciousness, perhaps they know that people (immigrant and non-immigrant alike) do not have what they need to survive in this society, and that in their capacities as law enforcers, they are not making things better for these millions of people. These are tough ethical problems for young people emerging from a context in which their futures are mortgaged ever more by the racial state's commitment to the needs of capital. </document> <Summary> There is only one such position in the anti-black world and it belongs to the black.
Slave codes in the southern United States demanded that slaves receive clothing, food, and lodging sufficient to their basic needs.
Slaves, although dead to civil rights and responsibilities-social death-are reduced to nothing but the physical body, unprotected against mutilation or torture.
The post-Emancipation era of the Black Codes, convict leasing, and lynching ensured that blackness meant social death not by virtue of enslavement, but instead as a product of criminality and imprisonment.
Blackness remains to this day the essential marker of criminality and deviance.
Black existence and its signifier 'criminal,' then, serve a central metaphorical and structural purpose for a white supremacist bourgeois society.
In the contemporary debates on immigration, it provides the menacing content for the construct 'criminal' that gives the anti-immigrant position its purchase in mainstream society.
We as educators cannot effectively undo the racism of anti-immigrant discourse without also challenging the anti-blackness of crime and punishment.
We need to recall the destruction of the black community base, the deindustrialization of the political economy, dismantling of the welfare state, and the installment of the prison industrial complex.
These processes collectively produced a black population available on a massive scale for social transfer to the living death of prison cages.
There would be no immigrant labor to speak of if the black liberation movement had not been systematically destroyed, and, ironically, that very same social movement history would not otherwise be available to other oppressed groups to learn and benefit from. </Summary>"
"<document> Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of a 400-foot observation wheel in Orlando, Florida, this month. Wallenda said Monday at a New York City news conference that the Orlando Eye will be moving when he attempts his feat April 29. The Orlando Eye, part of a new entertainment complex, will offer views of central Florida from inside 30 enclosed, air-conditioned glass capsules when it opens to the public on May 4. Scroll down for video . Eyes on the prize: High-wire performer Nik Wallenda announces his latest stunt at the 400-foot Orlando Eye, during a news conference, in New York on Monday . Tough challenge: The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29 . The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it's excited to have Wallenda attempt the 'amazing stunt.' No distance for the performance has been set yet, but Wallenda, 36, said he was not likely to walk the entire 20 minutes or so that it takes the wheel to go a full circle. Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz, California, but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart. The seventh-generation member of the 'Flying Wallenda' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. In November, he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness, doing the second walk blindfolded. Wallenda is the great-grandson of Karl Wallenda, who fell to his death in Puerto Rico at 73. </document> <Summary> Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of the 400-foot Orlando Eye observation wheel in Florida this month while it's moving.

Speaker 5: Mayor. City Council members. I'm Alan Teague. You're probably going to see me a lot tonight. I've read through the agreement and I also read through the feed study, which is the basis for this agreement. The 1.1. If you look at the three years where the budgets, it's 1.1, 1.0, 1.4.
Speaker 5: But in the fee study on page 18, it says there'll be a significant reduction in hourly billable hours next year, 4000 hours less, which is about $250,000. The budget doesn't reflect that. So my question is how will this savings be granted to the city of Alameda with this agreement?
Speaker 5: So it doesn't look like there's a way to get that money back. So please figure out a way to fix it so that when they do less hours, we don't have to pay for it. And when that 1.11.2 budget, we don't have to pay.
Speaker 0: Thank you, city manager. We would like to respond to that.
Speaker 4: So how the agreement works now and it's similar to the phase agreement is it's on a reimbursement basis and then the fee schedule is calculated from the previous year. So you will if there's we have savings of 250,000, it will be reflected in the new fee schedule the following year.
Speaker 0: All right. Thank you. And this I just want to clarify this is this money would be paid for out of the general fund if currently how? How will this money be paid?
Speaker 4: It is currently paid out of the general fund by council direction. And what is on the agenda later on tonight is to have the fee study be charged to buy a unit for each of the units.

"<document> The White House is assertively working to make America white again, and Democrats are too afraid to speak that truth. The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.The pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people. It should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration’s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. “By greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,” the economist Michael Clemens said.“Decades ahead,” he added, “many fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.” </document> <Summary> The White House is assertively working to make America white again, and Democrats are too afraid to speak that truth.

"<document> When Andriy Shevchenko netted the winning penalty to condemn Juventus to defeat in the 2003 Champions League final, they surely would not have envisaged it would take them this long to get back to Europe's top table. That penalty shootout followed a 0-0 draw which saw AC Milan crowned European champions in the first all-Italian final. Now, after a long journey, Juve are back among the continent's elite. Another goalless draw, this time against Monaco on Wednesday night, was more successful for Turin's Old Lady as they reached the Champions League semi-finals with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona on the horizon. Gianluigi Buffon was celebrated reaching the Champions League semi-finals, 12 years after final heartbreak . Juventus' players salute their supporters after the final whistle in Monaco having made it to the last four . Juve have endured a tough few years but they are now back were they belong among the elite of Europe . The 12-year gap between now and that night at Old Trafford has been one of twists and turns: relegations, promotions, league titles, stripped league titles and European failure at the hands of relative minnows like Fulham and Bordeaux. Captain Gianluigi Buffon said on Wednesday: 'I thought I'd have to wait less when I was at this stage 12 years ago, but seeing the journey was very difficult, we can enjoy this result even more. 'We knew it was a great opportunity and after 12 years we wanted to honour the history of Juve.' Even this season, Bianconeri supporters thought they were as good as out of this tournament as early as late October. A shock defeat by Olympiacos in Athens had them on the brink of exit before they scrambled to a runner-up spot in Group A behind Atletico Madrid. Then Borussia Dortmund gave them a mighty scare in the last-16 before the narrow win over Monaco. Andriy Shevchenko sent Buffon the wrong way with the winning penalty in the Old Trafford final on 2003 . The Juventus players, including Alessandro Del Piero (centre) reflect on their defeat in the showpiece final . Back in 2010, Juventus were downed by Fulham in the Europa League, a side now in the Championship . Pajtim Kasami celebrates after leaving Juve on the brink of exit back in October, but they made it through . Looking back, their group-stage progression is not too dissimilar to the club's fortunes over the last decade. After finishing third in Serie A the season after the 2003 final, Juventus came back to win the league twice in a row - only to be stripped of them both amid Italy's match-fixing scandal that sent them into the second division. On promotion, they took four further years to reach the summit of Italy's top tier once again but piece-by-piece, the nation's most successful side has rebuilt. That hasn't come easy, particularly with their domestic division being overtaken by England's Barclays Premier League, Spain's La Liga and the German Bundesliga. Talent is hard to tempt to Italy - as shown by the failings of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Roma. And when the talent does come, it is usually picked off by the big boys from abroad. The Italian champions were relegated to Serie B amid Italy's matchfixing scandal but soon rose back up . Juventus celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title last season, and they are on track for a fourth now . But not at Juventus. The side celebrating on the Stade Louis II pitch on Wednesday night included household names such as Buffon, Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal, while Paul Pogba - the most sought-after talent in Europe - is on his way back from injury. He could even be ready for the semi-finals, something any opponent would dread. They haven't conceded in their last three Champions League games - a hallmark of any great Italian side - and their comfortable domestic lead gives them all the time in the world to prepare for their final two or three matches in the competition. Buffon and Carlos Tevez hug on the pitch of the Stade Louis II, and they both have a point to prove . Arturo Vidal is one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe but he has stuck with Juve until now . Paul Pogba could be back in time for their semi-final next month and will likely be a key player in any clash . Barca, Real and Bayern should beware: the oldest team left in it have a point to prove, and for some this could be their last shot at European glory. Tevez has been linked with a return to South America after nine years in Europe. Andrea Pirlo, Patrice Evra and Buffon are not far from the end of their careers, either. Combine that with the midfield prowess of Pogba and Claudio Marchisio, and the solid defence provided by Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci and they just might do it. Juve will be the team that everyone wants to draw but nobody will enjoy playing against. Roberto Pereyra, Andrea Pirlo, Tevez and  Fernando Llorente celebrate reaching Europe's final four . Pirlo, aged 35, might be facing his best chance of one last European title with the Bianconeri this season . Vidal had it about right after Wednesday's game when he said: 'I am not afraid of anyone. 'I think all four teams in the semi-finals have their qualities and on Friday we'll see who we face, but right now I think we're on a par with all of them. We play with our heads now and are a mature team, I'd say.' The European giants wearing the famous black and white stripes might finally have awoken. </document> <Summary>  When Andriy Shevchenko netted the winning penalty to condemn Juventus to defeat in the 2003 Champions League final, they surely would not have envisaged it would take them this long to get back to Europe's top table.

"<document> Speaker 2: Please report the full council agenda item to Resolution 316 59 revising certain general rules and procedures of the Seattle City Council. Amending Chapter one a Resolution 316 39, Section 11 point D.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much. And this resolution and I'm going to move to a minute. In a moment, I'll introduce it. First is a resolution to change some fairly simple rules in the city hall in terms of court decorum.
Speaker 0: They're pretty common sensical. And I'll just sort of walk you through it, as I did this morning for those following the issue. We wanted to make the rules very clear that anyone just attempting to delay the public comment period by absolutely doing nothing but staring at us for blowing their nose or being silent without any discernible message
Speaker 0: that that is according to the law, can be construed as disruptive. And so that's not an encouraged or acceptable conduct here. We also want to make sure that any individual that or preventing another person from commenting by telling them to get out of their seat or any way intimidating them is also not acceptable according to our rules
Speaker 0: . We want to make sure that, again, another section that warnings can be given, but based on prior conduct as well, we can give a warning based on the prior conduct and by that we mean earlier in the week or just a pattern of behavior can be the basis for a warning.
Speaker 0: And then the other change is that we would like if if in fact, first of all, let me back up through the the formal rules allowed for the both the council president or the chair of the committee to give the warning or impose a sanction.
Speaker 0: This change allows any council member in any capacity participating in that meeting to be able to exercise that same authority. And then if in fact, the person wants to appeal, that they will do that at the next regularly scheduled full council meeting.
Speaker 0: Again, these have been approved by law and they think we think that it makes sense without offending anyone's right to free speech or constitutional speech and all of the liberties that we want to protect. I want to make a.
Speaker 0: An amendment to it just because we can do it at the committee. Describe what that amendment amendment is. It's basically the last part that I talked about, the appeal process being to the full council. Central staff pointed out that the prior rules allowed an appeal to the next committee.
Speaker 0: So there might have been an exclusion of the Parks Committee and the person appeals to the Transportation Committee. So we didn't think that made sense. We wanted to clean that up, and that's what the amendment is about. So first, I would like to move to amend Resolution 31659, which is the resolution just read Section 1d6 by substituting
Speaker 0: subsection six with a proposed language amended language provided on the agenda. And again, that's the appeal parts. They're second okay. Those in favor of the amendment please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The motion carries and the amendment passes.
Speaker 0: Another portion I do want to point out to my colleagues is unfortunately and this is the kind of rule that we've initiated or I've initiated that somewhat, one could argue, restricts free speech. To some extent. What we're more interested in is encouraging free speech and encouraging people that don't have the ability to come down here at 2:00
Speaker 0: or during our committee. So we're going to do some more work on how we can encourage and get more public comment. These rules are really designed to make sure anyone down here that comes are not intimidated by some of the craziness that you see, some of the hate speech that I see coming down here.
Speaker 0: That to me is quite disgusting. So we're going to do more work on trying to encourage free speech, and I thank you for their support on this resolution. Are there any further comments? Okay. I move to adopt resolution 31659 as amended their second.
Speaker 0: Any more comments? Those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended? Vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries the resolutions adopted as amended, and the chair will sign it. Thank you. Report of the Sustainability and Transportation Committee.
 </document> <Summary> Speaker 2 introduces a resolution to revise certain general rules and procedures of the Seattle City Council, focusing on court decorum.
Speaker 0 explains that the new rules aim to prevent disruptive behavior during public comment periods, such as delaying proceedings or intimidating others.
The rules also allow any council member to issue warnings or sanctions, and appeals can be made at the next full council meeting.
Speaker 0 proposes an amendment to the resolution to clarify the appeal process, which is approved.
Speaker 0 acknowledges that while some may view these rules as restricting free speech, the intention is to encourage free speech and ensure that people are not intimidated by disruptive behavior.
The resolution, as amended, is adopted. </Summary>"

"<document> Speaker 0: Yeah, thank you, Councilman Cashman. Looks like we have no other announcements, but we do have one presentation this evening. Tonight we have a presentation from Clear Parker Robinson Dance to highlight the opening of their photo exhibit, the premiere of Carmen.
Speaker 0: Many of us know her as Mama Cleo on the northeast side of Denver. So you want to come up to the.
Speaker 4: First of all, thank you so much for having a moment. And I just want to thank our wonderful Councilwoman Ortega and, of course, our our chair, who is in our district. And we're so proud. Now, I have an extraordinary weekend, but we have our ambassador of Mexico right with us.
Speaker 4: And I wanted our Ambassador Rendon to please come and join me because it is rare that we get her with this wonderful exhibit that we will be sharing at first at our theater starting on Friday night, Friday night.
Speaker 4: It begins the exhibit. And this is an extraordinary exhibit of Amalia Hernandez and her daughter is carrying on that legacy of the national dance company Folklorico de Mexico. And it is really 100 years that we're celebrating and not 100 years of Cleopatra Robinson dance.
Speaker 4: I've only been doing it for 47 years, but I've been in a building that's almost 100 years. But I would like for you to say a few words, if you would. Thank you very much. And good afternoon, everyone.
Speaker 4: Thank you, city councilors, for receiving us here this year.
Speaker 5: The consulate of.
Speaker 4: Mexico is celebrating the 125th anniversary that it was first established in Denver by precedent for future years. And we are having some activities along the year. First of all, we are going to start this weekend with a picture for the exhibition of Amalia Mendez, the founder of the ballet Folklorico de México.
Speaker 4: And she has set the example for all the girls all over the world. So we thank you for hosting this announcement and we need to tell you about it.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 4: With our opening. We have three premieres and they happen in Denver first and then they will travel the country and the world. And that is what we love doing, is sharing the magic of the powerful artists that we have.
Speaker 4: So our first work is at La Malattia of Cordoba, and I think it's really amazing. A historical work that we will be sharing starting Friday night will play Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So we want to invite the council to be there.
Speaker 4: We then have another work by Donal McHale, and Donal McHale is one of our American choreographers and he just made his transition one month ago. But he left a legacy of work that Broadway, New York, everywhere around the world knows his name as a choreographer.
Speaker 4: So we carry his work as a lead, a legacy work. And then my last work is Carmen and I will be performing Carmen. I choreographed it with a bossa nova approach. I did it with the symphony in 1989 or somewhere along there at Bettcher, and we opened it there, but we're doing it at our theater, bringing a
Speaker 4: sense of jazz, celebrating jazz in this country. And so we want you to join us. One of the things we realized and I wanted to thank Janelle Ayanna for making this connection between our companies in Denver and in Mexico City.
Speaker 4: She has just done a phenomenal job and of course, our staff, but has said has made material available for you. So let us know if you can join us, because it is a historic moment and we thank you for this time.
Speaker 4: I say. I say.
Speaker 0: I say. Thank you so much. Madam Ambassador, you are welcome here any time. Thank you so much. And of course, Mama. Cleo, we hope next time you can perform. Because, you know, once, once a month we have a performance for our Vision 2020 Plan for the Arts.
Speaker 0: So. Thank you. Okay, great. All right, we have. That was our presentation. Madam Secretary, you have any communications?

"<document> As the nation reframes its thinking about wildfire — from the routine natural burns of 50 years ago to today's climate-aggravated megablazes — it is crucial not to overlook the worst-case scenario: a major metropolis engulfed in fire. America has seen previews of this catastrophe: In 1991, a wildfire swept into the hills and canyons above Oakland, overwhelming firefighters, claiming 25 lives, injuring 150 other people and causing more than $1.5 billion in property damage. The 2003 Cedar Fire, driven by Southern California's fierce Santa Ana winds, scorched more than 280,000 acres. The worst fire in the state record books, the October blaze reached into the suburbs of San Diego, burning more than 2,200 homes. Wildfire hit again in 2007, forcing thousands of residents to take refuge in Qualcomm Stadium, the venue where the NFL's Chargers play. In a small blessing, the record fire season in the Pacific Northwest this summer has been relatively limited in its human and financial costs. The affected region is sparsely populated forest and rangeland, separated from Seattle and Portland by a major mountain range. But the fires' secondary effects on these cities shouldn't be discounted: In late August, shifting winds funneled dangerous smoke from multiple fires down through the Columbia Gorge, temporarily turning Portland into a smoke box. Particulate concentrations in the city's air reached ""unhealthy"" levels usually not seen outside Beijing. But in the big picture, America was lucky that wildfire hadn't struck the parched hills of Silicon Valley, or swept down through Colorado's Front Range into the suburbs west of Denver. Indeed, Northern California skirted disaster in July. The Rocky Fire — sparked by a decrepit water heater — threatened the city of Clear Lake, north of the state's fabled Napa Valley, ripping through 70,000 acres, jumping a highway and subjecting 13,000 residents to evacuation orders. Ken Pimlott, the director of CAL Fire, the state's fire authority, says California still faces ""unprecedented fire behavior and fuel conditions"" and that the worst of the fire season is likely ""yet to come"" in Southern California. ""We haven't dodged a bullet by any stretch of the imagination,"" he says. California Gov. Jerry Brown has recently been calling out the Republican presidential candidates who refuse to even acknowledge that climate change exists. ""Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts aren't on the horizon,"" he wrote in an open letter to GOP candidates. ""They're all here — and here to stay."" With a lightning strike or an arsonist's match, the fire next time could threaten San Jose, San Diego or the L.A. Basin — each a major engine of the national economy. At its most dangerous, warming-driven wildfire poses an existential threat. ""The climate is unstable,"" Brown told reporters in August. ""If the drought was to continue for a year or several years, California could literally burn up."" </document> <Summary> a major metropolis engulfed in fire.

"<document> The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock . Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed. For although the Apple Watch is officially going on sale, none of its stores will have them in stock. Instead, consumers willing to shell out between £299 to £13,500 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June. Usually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores. But City analysts believe the company feared the queues might be embarrassingly small and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. The watch includes a host of personal trackers, including a heart rate monitor, and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health. However, Apple also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory, with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap. As a result, limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world, which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today. These include the exclusive Dover Street Market in London's Mayfair, which is understood to have 570 of the watches, although not the gold edition. The launch of the watch into stores is being handled by Apple retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, who is very familiar with the world of designer labels. She was head of the luxury British fashion label Burberry, where she was one of the UK's highest paid women executives, before joining the US company last May. Her recruitment was sweetened with a golden hello of shares worth around £40million. She told Apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply. In it she said: 'We know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers. 'Luckily, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. 'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now. 'This was not an easy decision, and I think it's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category.' The official Apple UK website states anyone ordering the new watch can expect a delivery date in June, however some might get them before. Apple chief executive Tim Cook pictured giving a presentation on the Apple Watch in San Francisco last month . A spokesman said: 'Our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received. We know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.' Stuart Miles, technology expert and founder of website Pocket-lint.com, said: 'I think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad did five years ago. It's an intriguing device that has enough wow factor to pull people in.' But he added that the change in buying process this time - and the online backlog that has already begun - could put some people off. 'The biggest problem Apple looks to be facing, is not if people will buy one, it's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one,' he said. Will Findlater, editor-in-chief of gadget magazine Stuff, said: 'In many ways the Apple Watch is the ultimate gadget. Beautifully made and finished, hugely desirable and capable of a host of clever things, none of which you need, but many of which are nice to have. 'The functionality that could end up most compelling is messaging - the ability to send scrawled drawings, emoticons and even your heart beat direct to another Apple Watch owner feels personal in a way no other message platform does.' He added: 'The one-day battery life and price are the two factors that will put many buyers off. £300 or more is a lot to pay for a first-generation device, especially as Apple will learn a lot about making it better once it's in the market. 'That means the second or third-generation Apple Watch is probably the wiser buy. However, waiting would mean missing out on the fun of living with an entirely new, cutting-edge gadget right now, and for early adopters, that will be too much to bear.' Industry commentators believe the Apple Watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad (pictured) did five years ago . </document> <Summary> The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock.

"<document> Russia and China’s grand bargain on energy, a 30-year, $400 billion  deal to pipe natural gas from Russia’s   Far East to China, has prompted much commentary on the agreement’s potential to reshape global energy markets and tilt the balance of influence in Ukraine and, more broadly, in Europe. The deal has “upped the ante for Europeans to diversify their gas imports away from Russia,” said Erica Downs of the Brookings Institution; it means producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) “may face more competitive markets in Japan and South Korea, which together bought more than half of the world’s supply in 2013,” wrote Chou Hui Hong, a Singapore-based reporter for Bloomberg News; “the implications are potentially huge for Russia, for China and much of Asia, and also for Europe,” declared Keith Johnson, covering all the bases in Foreign Policy.¶ All the bases, that is, except one: the United States. The shale gas revolution in the States has led natural gas producers to envision an export boom in which U.S. companies become key suppliers to East Asia while countering Russian influence by shipping large amounts of LNG to Europe. President Obama said in 2012 that the U.S. is becoming “the Saudia Arabia of natural gas.”¶ Indeed, U.S. petroleum exports reached 3.5 million barrels a day in 2013, roughly double the level of 5 years ago, according to the Energy Information Administration. Proponents of increased LNG exports argue that the gas export boom will bring in billions in profits for American companies, create thousands of high-paying jobs, and reduce the influence of undesirable LNG suppliers, i.e., Vladimir Putin’s Russia.¶ All of that is, potentially, true. But there are signals that, even before the Russo-Chinese gas deal, natural gas advocates were overstating the potential market. And with China building pipelines to ship LNG across Central Asia, the market opportunity is dwindling fast. </document> <Summary> Russia and China’s grand bargain on energy, a 30-year, $400 billion deal to pipe natural gas from Russia’s Far East to China, has prompted much commentary on the agreement’s potential to reshape global energy markets and tilt the balance of influence in Ukraine and, more broadly, in Europe.

"<document> Discourses about school bullying and school safety for LGTBQ youth locate homophobic, transphobic, and misogynistic harassment as external to the standards, goals, and daily practices of schools. Yet, as I have demonstrated here, the pathologization of homosexuality, and the valorization of heterosexuality, are actually central to much sexuality education policy and curricula. And these are only the most visible and explicit of these forms of heteronormativity. The institutions and the larger socio-cultural-legal structures that surround the debates around school bullying elide the extent to which heteronormativity structures school standards, curricula and state education policies. In other words, while we frequently hear critiques (and fears) over the ‘promotion of homosexuality’ in schools when policies and curricula are inclusive and accepting of LGBTQ individuals and families, the range of explicit and implicit educational policies and curricula that promote heteronormativity are rarely central to public debates about the safety of LGBTQ students. The fact that in some schools students are explicitly told that their sexual desires are immoral, unhealthy or socially unacceptable is not central to debates about homophobic bullying. The findings of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) 2011 School Climate Survey suggests that further research and advocacy are needed on this. ‘A greater percentage of LGBT students regularly experienced verbal harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in schools with abstinence- only curricula’ (GLSEN, 2012: 50). In schools with abstinence-only sexuality education, 65.9% of students reported harassment due to sexual orientation and 48% due to gender identity, compared with 55.5% and 41.2% in schools with ‘other sexual health education’ (GLSEN, 2012: 50). Moreover GLSEN found ‘inclusive curriculum’ defined as ‘curriculum that includes positive representations of LGBT people, history and events’ (2012: xvi), correlated with lower rates of absenteeism, ‘a greater sense of connectedness,’ less homophobic language prevalent in schools, and greater reported acceptance. GLSEN reports that, ‘less than half (43.4%) of students in schools with an inclusive curriculum felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation, compared to almost two thirds (67.5%) of other students’ (2012: xvi). This evidence suggests that the state’s policies and curriculum may indeed legitimate homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and racist bullying in schools. If advocates and researchers are correct in linking homophobic bullying with higher suicide rates (GLSEN, 2010), then it is important to investigate the larger socio-cultural contexts of such bullying and raise a set of critical questions about these contexts. What are the consequences of the state’s articulation of belonging, normativity, and responsible citizenship in and through heterosexual familial and sexual reproduction? How do we think about belonging in the classroom, and in the nation in the context of the state’s promotion of heterosexuality through abstinence-only education? How do we think about what kinds of citizen-subjects schools are mandated to produce? The pedagogical solution to the problem I lay out here is not simply the inclusion of LGBTQ sexual behaviors in sexuality education policy, which supplements heteronormativity with homonormativity and leaves untouched hierarchies of normative and deviant sexual and familial lives (see e.g. Rubin, 1989). Nor does the solution lie in the criminalization of homophobic bullying, which shores up a prison industrial complex that disproportionately enacts state violence against LGBTQ youth of color (Spade, 2011). As scholars and activists imagine coalition building around these issues, it is vital that we not only ‘deconstruct heterosexuality first’ (Duggan, 1994), but that we take up the complicated co-constitutativeness of racism, white supremacy, heteronormativity, and the regulation of sexuality in schools, media, and law. The promotion of heteronormativity in sexuality eduation effectively does the epistemological work of the schoolyard bully – insisting that the LGBTQ teenager should not exist. Moreover, it implicitly legitimates the homophobic language and other forms of homophobic violence to which LGBTQ youth are subjected on a daily basis (see endnote 3). The political promise of Duggan’s challenge requires that we make the complex, damaging, and often violent effects of ‘‘the promotion of heterosexuality’’ visible. </document> <Summary> Discourses about school bullying and school safety for LGTBQ youth locate homophobic, transphobic, and misogynistic harassment as external to the standards, goals, and daily practices of schools.

"<document> We know swing voters are going extinct because of a political scientist named Corwin Smidt A few years ago, Smidt, who works at Michigan State University, was trying to reconcile two things. One was that there were more and more people identifying as independents, rather than Democrats or Republicans. That should've meant that there were a huge number of people who were willing to change their minds, since they weren't partisan. But Smidt also noticed that over this time period, the presidential election maps didn't change much. It was “much more rigid."" One way to reconcile these two things was to believe that independents were no longer participating, which means there were fewer nonpartisan voters. But Smidt had another question: Are these self-labeled nonpartisans actually willing to vote for Republicans one election and Democrats in another? So he decided to study historical surveys that asks Americans about how they voted. He came up with four groups for the respondents: He did this for every year going back 50 years. What he found was simple, though shocking: Even though more and more people don’t align with a party, they still consistently behave like reliable partisans and repeatedly vote for the same party. In other words, swing voters are dying. Why are swing voters going extinct? Most voters look at where the parties stand on the issues, and then they pick one that best reflects their own views. But if you don’t pay enough attention to tell the parties apart, then you won’t know which party you agree with. That makes you more likely to swing between parties. So if we redraw the picture at the top, it would look like this. Notice how similar the two sides look to her: And it used to be common for people with less political knowledge to switch the party they supported from election to election — whether or not they voted. But over time, this party switching has become far less common: This is because now even low-information voters can tell the two parties apart: Even low-information voters say there’s an important difference between Republicans and Democrats In 1960, both partisans and nonpartisans were much less likely to say there was a big difference between Republicans and Democrats. Now almost all strong partisans would say yes — and even half of nonpartisans would say yes. In short, voters are more confident that they know exactly what they’re voting for when they look at the “D” or the “R” next to a candidate’s name — no matter how partisan they are. And it's not just about partisanship. A modern-day person with low political awareness can tell the parties apart just as well as someone who had high awareness in 1968: How is it that swing voters can now tell the parties apart? Polarization. It's not that the people have changed. Rather, it's the parties. Let's go back to the drawing at the top of the story. Here's where we were in the 1950s, where a low-information voter would look at the parties and not be able to tell the difference. But over the past 50 years, the two parties have evolved very distinct platforms. In the 1968 election, neither Republican Richard Nixon nor Democrat Hubert Humphrey articulated clear views on what he would in Vietnam. ""This ambivalence and deliberate obfuscating can create opportunity to win voters over,"" Smidt said. Before Ronald Reagan, the Republican Party didn't have an anti-abortion position. At the 1996 State of the Union, Bill Clinton said, ""The era of big government is over."" It was a lot harder to pin down each party to specific issues, especially for those who weren't paying close attention. But now the party lines are clear on abortion, taxes, climate change, health care, same-sex marriage — the list goes on. That's why when we look at how much Republicans and Democrats agree in the House and Senate, we see more and more polarization: </document> <Summary> A few years ago, Corwin Smidt, a political scientist at Michigan State University, noticed that more people were identifying as independents, rather than Democrats or Republicans, but the presidential election maps didn't change much.
Smidt studied historical surveys that asked Americans about how they voted and found that even though more people don’t align with a party, they still consistently behave like reliable partisans and repeatedly vote for the same party.
Most voters look at where the parties stand on the issues, and then they pick one that best reflects their own views.
Over time, party switching has become far less common because even low-information voters can tell the two parties apart.
In short, voters are more confident that they know exactly what they’re voting for when they look at the “D” or the “R” next to a candidate’s name.
The ability of swing voters to now tell the parties apart is due to polarization, not because the people have changed, but because the parties have evolved very distinct platforms over the past 50 years. </Summary>"

'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.' FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid - understood to be around £4m - for Muto, who has 11 caps and one goal for his country.

"<document> Mimeticism here is no longer simply a literary convention, however. Rather, it is a type of representational copula-tion forced at the juncture between literature and ethnicity, a reflectionism that explicitly or implicitly establishes equivalence between a cultural practice and an ethnic label—in the form of ""this kind of poetic/narrative convention is Chinese."" In this equation —this act to validate a particular kind of writing as ethnic difference per se— mimeticism, chastised though it may be at the formal level as an evil Western tradition, returns with a vengeance as the stereotyped way to control and police the reception of literary writing. In the hands of the sinolo-gists, even ancient poems and narratives, it turns out, are documentaries—of what is Chinese. In the study of modern Chinese literature, such mi-meticism between writing and ethnicity, which has all along been foisted on Third World literature in general, would receive a different name—national allegory—soon to be adopted widely even among Chinese critics. Meanwhile, the émigrés who can no longer claim proprietorship to Chinese culture through residency in China henceforth inhabit the melan-choly position of an ethnic group that, as its identity is being ""authenticated"" abroad, is simultaneously relegated to the existence of ethnographic speci-mens under the Western gaze. Worth mentioning in this context is the work of Tsi-an Hsia, who, in the 1950s, attempted, in Taiwan, to reinvigo-rate Chinese writing by advocating, through borrowing the principles of the Anglo-American New Critics, serious attitudes toward ""new poetry?' One of the results of this attempt to rediscover the true poet's voice, however, was a further displacement of the ethnicity that such literary efforts were supposed to consolidate—the trend among Chinese students from Taiwan to study abroad in the United States, eventually bringing the habits of New Criticism to bear on their reading of Chinese literature overseas.32 As Gunn comments, ""It is tempting to conclude that T. A. Hsia and his students had not brought modern literature to Taiwan but had moved Chinese literature to the United States."" 33 In exile, Chinese writing (first in Taiwan, then in the United States) is condemned to nostalgia, often no sooner reflecting or recording the ""reality"" of Chinese life overseas than rendering Chineseness itself as something the essence of which belongs to a bygone era.34 Even so, the coerciveness of the typical mimeticism between representation and ethnicity continues.35 No matter how nonmimetic, experimental, subversive, or avant-garde such diasporic writing might try to be, it is invariably classified, marketed, and received in the West as Chinese, in a presupposed correspondence to that reality called China. As in the case of representations by all minorities in the West, a kind of paternalistic, if not downright racist, attitude persists as a method of categorizing minority discourse: Minorities are allowed the right to speak only on the implicit expectation that they speak in the documentary mode, ""reflecting"" the group from which they come. </document> <Summary> Mimeticism here is no longer simply a literary convention, however.

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United . The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game . Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets . The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets . 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were . Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon . West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday . Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The ""bad old days"" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of ""fans"" have thankfully been left far behind us now.

"<document> This elitism is a hallowed tradition of the European avant-garde. For decades, radical intellectuals have adopted dissident politics, aesthetics and morals to separate themselves from the majority of 'herd animals' whose minds were controlled by bourgeois ideologies.

Following this elitist custom, the Deleuzoguattarians champion nomadic minorities from the 'non-guaranteed' social movements against the stupified majority from the 'guaranteed'sector. Once again, the revolution is the ethical-aesthetic illumination of a minority rather than the social liberation of all people.

"<document> Earlier this year, Russian Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev told Russian state news that two Typhoon-class submarines--Arkhangelsk and Severstal--could re-enter service after a deep refit, notably including a weapons suite upgrade to over 200 Kalibr cruise missiles: “the dimensions of each of these submarines allows them to be armed with at least 200 [Kalibr] cruise missiles each.” Burtsev’s proposal drew its share of skepticism, centered around cost and practicality concerns. It now appears that Russia’s Northern Fleet plans to give at least one of its Typhoon submarines a new lease on life, though not quite in the way that Burtsev intended. Dmitri Donskoi, the first Typhoon-class vessel and the largest submarine in the world, served for the past decade as an RSM-56 Bulava ballistic missile testbed. In 2018, it was announced that Donskoi will undergo a deep refit to join the upcoming Borei line as one of two Russian submarine classes to deploy Bulava missiles. Earlier this week, the press office of Russia’s Northern Fleet announced that Donskoi has completed combat trials in the White Sea. It is unclear if a similar fate awaits Arkhangelsk and Severstal, which were decommissioned in the mid 2000’s and have sat in a Severodvinsk repair port ever since. But even if Donskoi will be the only one to receive this treatment, serious logistical problems persist. Not only is there a heavy upfront bill to refitting as old and large a vessel as Donskoi, but the maintenance costs of a modernized Typhoon submarine would far exceed that of its much smaller and leaner Borei counterparts. What does the Russian Navy stand to gain from such a daunting and expensive project, involving everything from titanium derusting to nuclear reactor replacement? Prestige, for one. Typhoon is arguably the most feared and renowned submarine line ever constructed by Russia or its Soviet predecessor state; a household name from such classic films as the Hunt for Red October, but also a genuinely potent centerpiece of the Soviet SLBM arsenal from 1981 onward. There is, however, a technical case for refitting at least one Typhoon vessel. Russia’s emerging modernization model of a lean, local, rapid-response force may be a cost-effective way to guarantee the integrity of Russia’s sprawling coastlines but has increasingly left the Russian Navy without a maritime means of conducting saturation strikes in a high intensity combat setting. Burtsev notes that Russia’s current submarine lineup compares unflatteringly with the refitted US Ohio-class submarines, capable of fielding a whopping 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. He adds that even Russia’s surface ships, like the new Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, struggle to match this volume of firepower; the aging, heavily armed Kirov-class Petr Velikiy “battlecruiser” is the sole exception. </document> <Summary> Russian Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev announced that two Typhoon-class submarines--Arkhangelsk and Severstal--could re-enter service after a deep refit, including a weapons suite upgrade to over 200 Kalibr cruise missiles.

Because the next generation of drones won't have pilots. The new Al software will give drones decision-making capability. 
They'll assess the data and take lethal action all on their own. 
Really will be rise of the machines. 
Those new drones would turn that car to ash without hesitation. 
That's why, when lives are at stake,

"<document> Inter Milan target Yaya Toure has admitted that he is open to 'new challenges' and will not remain at Manchester City just to pick up his £220,000-a-week wages. The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham . Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer . Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision . Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can.' </document> <Summary> Inter Milan target Yaya Toure has admitted he is open to new challenges and will not stay at Manchester City just for his £220,000-a-week wages.
Toure, wanted by former manager Roberto Mancini at Inter, seems open to leaving City if the right chance comes this summer.
Toure said no amount of money will make him stay somewhere he doesn't feel he belongs or faces no challenge.
He added he will go where he's offered new challenges, as numbers don't stop him.
Toure said he owes it to City fans to fight until the end of his career at the club.
His decisions won't be affected by management changes, but by the challenges offered.
City are fourth in the Premier League after a poor run, and out of the Champions League.
Toure's form has disappointed this season, so City may try to sell him. </Summary>"

"<document> The other reason to believe California will be able to exploit available legal opportunities is logistical. Legal revolutions are not built on ideas alone. They also require an infrastructure—and a set of institutional actors with the will and capacity to advance novel legal claims and make them stick.

Notable as well is California’s recent high-profile retention of former Attorney General Eric Holder to quarterback the state’s strategizing on federalism matters.13 Even local governments have built impressive litigation shops and staffed them with some of the best and brightest young lawyers.

"<document> (CNN)One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences. ""Roots,"" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries.

"<document> Leanna Norris (pictured during her trial) admitted killing her young daughter . A mother who drugged her young daughter with allergy medicine before smothering her to death has been jailed for 37 years. Leanna Norris, 25, of Auburn,  plied two-year-old Loh Grenada with Benedryl to make her sleep before by covering her mouth and nose with duct tape and a blanket, a court heard. The body was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 24, 2013. Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norrishad committed the murder to stop her ex-boyfriend, the father of her child, dating other women. 'She did not want (his new girlfriends) mothering her child,' reported the Bangor Daily News. Norris wept as she told the Judge: 'I want it to be known that I'm sorry to everyone that I have hurt,' reported the newspaper. 'All I ever wanted was for her to be safe and us to be together forever.' The court heard that Norris had suffered from mental health problems including depression, and had tried to commit suicide after she killed her daughter. But Superior Court Justice Ann Murray had rejected Norris' insanity defense and found her guilty. Norris admitted to investigators that on the evening of June 23, 2013, she drove her daughter, Loh Melody Grenda, to Durham Bridge Road in Newport and gave her three times the normal dose of an antihistamine. She put duct tape over the girl’s mouth and nose, then smothered her with a blanket so she would not have to watch her die, according to the trial testimony. The mother then drove to a cemetery in Stetson and took the rest of the antihistamine and swallowed 200 Advil pills in a suicide attempt. Norris told police that she had broken up with Loh’s father and he had threatened to try to get sole custody of the girl. Norris, 25, had drugged two-year-old Loh Grenada (pictured) then covered her mouth and nose with duct tape . Cowardly act: The court heard that Norris allegedly had covered her daughter with a blanket while she smothered her so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes' Martha Harris, who is representing Norris, told the courtroom that her client was depressed and had both anxiety and mood disorders last year, according to the newspaper. Norris' ex-boyfriend Michael Grenda, who was the father to two-year-old Loh Grenda, testified about the parents' estranged relationship, according to the newspaper. His testimony reportedly included that the couple's verbal disputes led to police being dispatched on multiple occasions -- and though Grenda broke up with Norris on June 16, 2013, the two agreed to stay and parent in the same residence. Norris' digital communications with different men stopped a potential reunion, he also said, according to Bangor Daily News. Grenda reportedly recounted his telling Norris on June 23 'that was the end of everything' - and then 'She became very upset. She was crying and smashing her head against the wall.' The 27-year-old's testimony also reportedly revealed that Norris cooled off that morning through his help, he left the home in the afternoon, and found out what happened to Loh Grenda on June 24. Suicidal: Leanna Norris allegedly asked for a gun after her daughter's death in order to take her own life . Testimony: Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder and 'did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child . The suspect's father Steven Norris said he received a 2.27am phone call on June 24 from his daughter, in which she admitted to killing Loh. He then contacted the authorities while Norris was one the phone with her mother. Norris later turned up at her parents' home with the dead body inside the car. He told the court she had been feeling suicidal and had asked for a gun, according to the Bangor Daily News. Her affidavit by Maine State Police Detective Thomas Pickering said she offered 'two or three syringes of Benadryl to make [Loh Grenda] go to sleep.' 'Leanna Norris put black Gorilla [duct] tape on Loh Grenda's mouth and nose; that Leanna Norris put a blanket over Loh Grenda's face so she would not have to look at Loh's eyes,' the affidavit reportedly said. ' Leanna Norris said that she killed Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda's face and suffocated her.' Judge: Superior Court Justice Ann Murray is pictured at the bench during the trial at Penobscot Judicial Center, Bangor . Assistant Attorney General Leann Zainea appears for the prosecution (left) across from defense attorney Martha Harris (right) Norris said she took the tape off 'so it would not look so horrible', the affidavit is said to reveal. Later at a Stetson cemetery was 'where [Leanna Norris] took pills and put tape on her face in order to kill herself,' the affidavit also reportedly said. But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house, where he discovered his granddaughter dead under a blanket. Norris, who had asked to be tried without a jury, had told the judge that she didn't set out to kill her daughter and her defense asked for the minimum sentence of 25 years. But Mr Grenada, Loh's father, had branded the request 'a joke' and recommended a 45 term for the 'premeditated' killing. Justice Murray sentenced Norris to 37 years in prison after taking into account the child's suffering and her mother's mental illness. </document> <Summary> Leanna Norris, 25, of Auburn, admitted to killing her young daughter by drugging her with allergy medicine before smothering her to death.

"<document> Speaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. That concludes the questions or comments on this item. Madam Secretary, will you please put the next item on our screens, which should be 1177, which is the bill creating the Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency.
Speaker 0: And I just wanted to call this bill out to, again, thank all my colleagues, to thank the administration and to thank all of the citizens who pushed really hard for this and have been pushing us to elevate this conversation around climate change and pushing us to step up our response on this issue.
Speaker 0: This is a huge step in the right direction, but our work is not done here. We have a long way to go until we can say that we're doing everything that we need to do as a city to meet the science based targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Speaker 0: I look forward to seeing this office stood up and focused on this critical work, and I also look forward to the forthcoming Climate Task Force meetings and the hard work that that task force will undertake. Looking at what we are currently doing, what we what more we need to be doing and how we close that gap.
Speaker 0: And I look forward to this body continuing to push hard on this issue until we know that we are doing our part and everything that we can as a city to solve this global crisis. So, Councilman Hines, did you also want to make a comment or ask question?
Speaker 5: Well, no question. But I do want to make a comment. Mr. President, I want to thank you also for for pulling this out. And I want to thank my colleagues and everyone who's worked on this. I think this is a critical program I want to our initiative.
Speaker 5: I also want to mention I was fortunate to stand with the mayor, the governor, the lieutenant governor, the executive director of CDOT and Lyft. Last week when they unveiled that they are adding 200 electric vehicles to their fleet in the in the city.
Speaker 5: And I want to say, this is an example of how we should all do our part as individuals and as organizations to to to work to to make this a better planet to a cleaner planet and a more sustainable planet.
Speaker 5: And and so I think that even, you know, companies like Lyft should be celebrated. And and I think that they the governor and Lyft both last week gave a gentle challenge. I would bring the same thing again and say, we should all do our part, not just individuals, not just government agencies.
Speaker 5: But I love the gentle challenge that that left in the governor had companies we would love to support you in your quest to become more sustainable as well. Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. All right. That concludes the items to be called out this evening.

Speaker 0: District and Resolution 11 zero six concerning the Reno Denver General Improvement District. After the recess, Council will hold separate public hearings on these three councilmembers. Remember, this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote.
Speaker 0: Otherwise, this is your last opportunity to call an item out for a separate vote. All right, Councilman, can we please put the resolutions for adoption in the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor?

"<document> (CNN)How would you get your nation's president to hear you out? Put your name and number on a mango and hit him in the head with it? No? Then you're not Marleni Olivo, who did exactly that, and in return is getting the new apartment she was asking for, said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Olivo, 54, saw her opportunity when Maduro visited Anzoategui, the state where she lives. Maduro, a former bus driver, drove a bus to a rally Wednesday where he was meeting with supporters. The president had the window open, the better to greet people attending the rally. Olivo had written a message on a mango -- ""If you can, call me,"" -- along with her name and phone number. She got as close as she could and, as the bus passed, she tossed the fruit at Maduro. In a video that has gone viral in Venezuela, Maduro is shown lowering his head when he is hit, just above the left ear. He then calmly picks up the mango and holds it up to the crowd. Later in the evening, the president mentioned the incident in one of his customary live TV broadcasts and displayed the infamous mango as proof. ""Marleni Olivo,"" Maduro said. ""We're going to invite her to my [TV and radio] show, 'In Touch with Maduro.' She had a housing problem, right? And, Marleni, I have approved it already, as part of the Great Housing Mission of Venezuela, you will get an apartment and it will be given to you in the next few hours. Tomorrow, no later than the day after tomorrow, we will give it to you."" Maduro also joked that he had something in common with the mango. The word ""maduro"" in Spanish means ripe. Olivo told local media her intention was to toss the president a note, as others in the crowd were doing. ""I didn't have paper available at that moment,"" she told El Pitazo TV. ""What I had was a mango that I was about to eat because I was hungry."" Maduro's critics are calling the incident a ""manguicidio,"" a play on the words ""mango"" and ""magnicidio,"" a Spanish word meaning assassination of a powerful leader. In Venezuela's extremely polarized political climate, Maduro frequently talks about his belief that the opposition is conspiring to target him for assassination. But the mango-thrower says she had no evil intent. ""My dream is to own a home before I die,"" she told El Pitazo TV, adding that she had been very ill recently, that she suffers from diabetes and hypertension. And now her dream is about come true, a dream that would not have been possible without her boldness and a little help from a tasty mango. </document> <Summary> How would you get your nation’s president to hear you out?

"<document> A second set of changes concerns the character of the law of nations itself. That law once primarily governed the relations of states to one another, but it now also concerns the relations of states to their own citizens, 37 as well as a host of commercial, environmental, and other matters. 38 These concerns extend well beyond the traditional matters of war and peace upon which Professors Bellia and Clark focus, and it is far from clear that the judicial power that Bellia and Clark recognize to incorporate the law of nations ought to extend to the far broader modern sweep of international law. As Bellia and Clark probably recognize, judicial application of this modern international law often will not protect political branch prerogatives, and it may in fact undermine those prerogatives. Moreover, the modern law of nations is formed in quite different ways than the international law known to the Framers. This is true not only of CIL, which is now more a creature of world opinion than a reflection of nations' actual practice, 39 but also of multilateral treatymaking and international norms promulgated by supranational institutions exercising delegated lawmaking power. Parallel changes have affected the enforcement of international law. Breaches of the modern law of nations may be addressed not simply by the aggrieved nation, but by a variety of multilateral institutions, and the range of possible punishments includes trade sanctions and a variety of other measures short of war. Whatever the felt necessity for federal  [*38]  judicial incorporation of the law of nations when few alternative enforcement mechanisms existed to avoid the use of military force by some other nation, under current circumstances such unilateral judicial action is both less pressing and more likely to complicate the working out of international disputes through other political and legal mechanisms. </document> <Summary> A second set of changes concerns the character of the law of nations itself.

#Person2#: Well, I was really upset about some countries failure to sign up pollution control agreements. It felt like the science wasn't getting understood by the politicians, so I decided to look into what I personally could do, that led me to dream up a cartoon character called Mr. Carbon. We all know somebody like him, he's climate ignorant and makes no effort to save energy. Of course, factories are the obvious bad character in the real world, but I couldn't do much about them.
#Person1#: So, are we going to see him in scenes like we get in disaster movies?
#Person2#: That's pretty unlikely, it's hard to make a box office success. But he certainly gives cause for concern. People are becoming more aware of the climate change.
#Person1#: So you came up with the idea of another cartoon character, Mrs. Green.

"<document> The mother of a high school student who has been prevented from attending classes as a consequence for not wearing the right style shoes has expressed her outrage over the 'ridiculous' situation. Riley Filmer, 14, turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at McClelland College, in Melbourne's south-east, only to be told that the black soft-leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards. The Year Eight student was prevented from attending her classes for the day, and has not been allowed back into the classroom since the incident, which her mother Anne Parker claims has disadvantaged and excluded her daughter. Riley Filmer, 14, has been prevented from attending classes at her Melbourne high school because her shoes do not meet the strict uniform guidelines . The secondary school's policy outlined in the 2015 Personal Learning Journal states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)' for both summer and winter uniforms, a guideline which Ms Parker said Riley's shoes meet. Ms Parker said that after going through five pairs of shoes in four school terms, she decided that her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs. 'Rain, hail, or shine Riley has to walk to catch the bus, and then switch to another bus to get to school because of my work, and so we decided to look into a different type of shoe than the ones we had been buying,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. 'Is it that big a deal that my daughter has shoes they don't care for? Kids walk and skate, and catch a bus or a train, not every child gets driven to school. The rules need to cater for comfortable and practical shoes,' she said. The rubber-soled soft leather lace-ups were pointed out by a teacher on the first day of term, and Riley was taken to the school's office, where she was offered a pair of shoes from lost property, and remained until the end of the day. Ms Parker was not contacted to let her know that her daughter had been taken out of class, and said that she has had no contact with the principal of the school, Amadeo Ferra, despite Mr Ferra issuing a statement on Thursday reinforcing the uniform guidelines. The secondary school's policy states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)', which Ms Parker said the shoes comply to . Ms Parker said  her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs . 'I just can't make sense of this. They've shifted the goal posts on what they are expecting of the uniform. When I spoke to the vice-principal yesterday I was told that her shoes aren't the type of shoes they're looking for, even though they are black leather lace-ups,' she said. Ms Parker was informed that the school was looking for shoes with more of a heel, but has been left baffled as to why her daughter is being punished for a non-existent rule. 'Why has she not been allowed to attend class while this grey area is being cleared up? If I decided to pull her out of school for four days, I would be in trouble. But for some reason they can pull my daughter out of classes simply because they don't like her shoes'. The 14-year-old has not been allowed back into classes since Monday, which Ms Parker said has caused significant issues when it comes to her daughter completing her school work. 'The school said that she hasn't been given an in-school suspension, but I don't know how else to look at it. She can't go to class. What is that if not a suspension?' Ms Parker said. 'She has been allowed to approach each of her teachers at the beginning of the lesson to ask for work, and some have given her work, but some haven't,' she said. 'It's the start term and so she is really struggling to complete work because she's not in class to have things explained to her.' Ms Parker also said that she pointed out to the school that being unable to attend classes and prevented from joining in with her classmates was exclusion, which went against the school's own policy. The school offered to buy Riley a pair of shoes which met the standards of the uniform policy, but Ms Parker said that she had declined the offer as she did not understand why her daughter was not able to wear comfortable shoes that she already owned. Ms Parker said that her daughter was being excluded from classes, which breached McClelland College's own policy on bullying and harassment . McClelland College's principal Amadeo Ferra said that the school was sticking by the uniform policy . Mr Ferra released a statement on Thursday addressing the issue. 'Our students are expected to wear black leather lace-up shoes. Shoes with a flat sole — ‘skate-style shoes’ — are not acceptable,' Mr Ferra said. 'We have done everything to assist the family concerned, including offering the student a pair of appropriate shoes,' he said. 'We still expect the student to wear the appropriate shoes but will be ensuring she receives regular classroom teaching, which is what we have always wanted,' reported The Herald Sun. Mr Ferra said that McClelland College's uniform policy was set by the school council, and involved consultation with the school community. Ms Parker said that she was disappointed and frustrated with the school, and couldn't understand why her daughter's shoes were drawing so much attention when the school had much larger issues. 'I had another parent say to me that she couldn't believe they were worried about school shoes when there are students walking around the local shops in school hours,' she said. 'Other parents have thanked me for sticking up for the kids and not letting the issue be swept under the carpet.' 'It seems trivial and sad when we look at what's going on in society and with kids these days. I just find it ridiculous'. Ms Parker has contacted her local MP, and has also submitted a complaint with the Victorian Board of Education, and hopes to get a response within the next two days. McClelland College has been contacted for comment. </document> <Summary> Riley Filmer, 14, turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at McClelland College, in Melbourne's south-east, only to be told that the black soft-leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards.

"<document> The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all facing increased difficulties attracting servicemembers, but shifting US immigration policies may make the military a less appealing option for some of the most sought-after recruits. ""At the end of the day, people are what makes everything work, and we really have to focus on this. Going forward we're all going to have a real war for talent,"" Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer said Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sitting alongside Army Secretary Mark Esper and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. ""The three of us up here fish from the same pool, and we're all going to be looking for more people to do more things in a more intelligent manner,"" Spencer said. Senior military officials have emphasized increased recruiting and growing the size of their forces as key components of improving readiness. Wilson said in September that the Air Force was ""too small for what's being asked of us."" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said in October that he had believed for ""quite some time"" that the Army needed to add more soldiers. ""We need to grow in order to meet the demands that the nation expects at the readiness levels it expects,"" Milley said. Recruiting has been a stumbling block for the armed services. Last year, the Army — which is seeking 80,000 troops in 2018, 11,000 more than were sought in 2017 — started accepting less-qualified troops, offering heftier bonuses, and granting more waivers for previously disqualifying things, like marijuana use and, in some cases, histories of mental illness. The Army was adamant that it was not lowering its standards — rather it was changing the level of authority at which decisions about waivers for some standards were being made. Recruiting efforts have also been complicated by a robust US economy. While the Pentagon has met its recruiting targets in recent years, low unemployment rates, common during the past few years, are seen as a hindrance.

"<document> Ben Stokes starred with the ball on the first day of England's warm-up match in St Kitts, but it was the runs of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott that pleased him most. England dominated against a modest St Kitts & Nevis XI, dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply. The quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session, though Stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10. Alastair Cook plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a St Kitts' XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . More important for England's Test prospects, though, was the stand of 158 between Cook (95 not out) and Trott (72). Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.' </document> <Summary> Ben Stokes starred with the ball on the first day of England's warm-up match in St Kitts.

"<document> An artist with a surreal take on the natural world uses Photoshop to create whimsical, mind-bending pictures that would give Salvador Dali a run for his money. Anil Saxena, from Mumbai, uses ingenious retouching to create pictures of anything from a woman hanging a zebra's stripes on the line to dry to a pair of hands knitting a green field. He prides himself on his digital manipulation techniques, saying: 'If the image is a success but my work goes unnoticed, I'm doing my job well.' A woman in a colourful sari hangs up a zebra's stripes on a washing line . The photographer who has a background in graphic design and CGI, initially retouched his pictures by hand. Once he  started digital retouching he was able to turn his pictures into more complex flights of fancy. According to his biography on Design Taxi, the artist,  says the real work begins when 'lesser mortals might think that the image is just perfect.' The art website Behance says: 'Anil enjoys developing stunning imagery. He believes colour grading is paramount.' A painter colours  a giraffe as he leans a ladder against the animal . A sink is utilised as a swimming pool by a group of tiny people . Anil's photo manipulations blend the everyday with the bizarre, such as a man in a boiler suit climbing a ladder to paint a giraffe's distinctive coat pattern. In another a crystal swimming pool in which beautiful people lounge in bikinis or take a dip, is realised as a sink and instead of a giant diving board, they're all underneath a huge chrome tap. In other images there's the juxtaposition of indoors and outside, so a woman's bed piled with feature duvets and pillows is standing on dunes by the sea - rather than in her bedroom. A picture called 'Bring Home Nature, Bring Home Joy, features a man riding a bicycle with a whole tree in his bike's basket, which sheds leaves against the setting sun. A woman is overjoyed to find her bed in the middle of nature, by the sea . A man on a bike carries a tree in his basket in this image called 'Bring home nature, bring home joy' A couple sit and admire a setting sun by their parked bikes... on top of a forest . A pair of newlyweds have a moment by a lush four poster bed in a field by some trees . The top of a forest is expertly blended with a grass meadow in another shot. At first glance it appears that a couple are relaxing together on the grass, look closer and it's clear that they are in fact sitting on dense tree tops.

Speaker 2: Over the last couple of weeks, I've had the opportunity to speak with our Bonn Council for the airport, as well as our legal advisor. And I want to thank Phil Washington, Crystal de Herrera and Mike Shanahan for their help and assistance in getting these meetings set up.
Speaker 2: You all received a copy of the questions that I asked in the answers that they provided in writing. I know some of you still had additional questions, and rather than debating all of that on the floor tonight, I thought it made sense for you all to have the opportunity to get your questions answered between now and next
Speaker 2: Monday so that when we bring it back, hopefully we have the votes to move it forward. I am very comfortable with the financial status of where we are. If you take into account the fact that we made it through a pandemic and never had to dip into our 500 plus days of cash that are on hand, and
Speaker 2: I kept looking for that unanticipated situation that might occur in the future and really feel comfortable that our team has done an amazing job in looking out for the fiscal health of our airport and making sure that we can not only do this, but still have those reserves that are needed to be able to move us forward
Speaker 2: to allow any of the future capital projects to be done, as well as the financing that is going to come forward this year. If you recall, in 2021, we did some interim restructuring of some of our financing and that will come back as permanent financing in 2022.
Speaker 2: So with all of that, we're still able to keep our cost per employment in in the middle of the range compared to all of the other airports and really believe that that's in large part to our consultants and our amazing staff that we have at the airport who constantly are looking out for the financial well-being of our
Speaker 2: airport. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. And as a quick reminder to folks in chambers and the public listening, our Rule 3.7 doesn't require a motion. Any councilmember can make that request of a resolution and pull it off the agenda for one week.

Speaker 4: We need plumbing moved, we need whatever. We can't just stop in the middle. This is a project that needs to be finished and it needs to be finished the right way. It looks like the scope of this project is the right way.
Speaker 4: I want to remind folks who might be watching and folks here in the chambers that this is no longer the great mall project.

Speaker 4: We're not turning the gypsum terminal into a shopping center, but this is making the airport. The kind of airport we would have designed in the eighties and nineties when we conceived it. If we had known that 19 guys with box cutters were going to change the aviation industry.
Speaker 4: So this rearrangement and relocation of security is something I think this body has spoken pretty clearly needs to be done completely. This phase three would do that. The heartburn that a lot of us are having is simply with the price tag.

Executive Overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of Video Recording Systems. The committee recommends the bill passes amended.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Councilor Petersen. As chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to address this item.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Colleagues, this is the last of these Council 120055 as your surveillance impact report covering an existing camera system used only at speed facilities. After adopting amendments, our committee unanimously recommended approval. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, are there any comments or questions from council members on the presentation and passage of this bill? And I must get up.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much. I am again sorry to ask some questions and I'm sure you dealt with committee but council member Petersen as chair of the committee, perhaps this is for you or the President pro tem as chair of public safety.
Speaker 0: Did I understand correctly that this is an existing technology that we're now approving? How come SPV had approval to use it prior to today's authorization?
Speaker 2: That is the nature of the beast. Councilmember Petersen.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure. This surveillance ordinance that was originally adopted in 2017 and then refined by Council President Gonzalez in 2018 and others, this is the process where it goes first, goes through the surveillance working group, the volunteer surveillance working group.
Speaker 1: The department puts together report. It's reviewed by the Information Technology Department just to scope out exactly what the technology does and what the concerns, whether it is surveillance has surveillance capabilities, what concerns might be what the litigants are to those concerns.
Speaker 1: And it works its way through this process to get to us. And then, like I said, the Office of the Inspector General continues to monitor this going forward.
Speaker 2: But the thing that is at that is the case for all of the technology that all of the departments currently use at the time of the passage of the surveillance ordinance. So that's what we when we talk about the retrospective technologies, we're talking about surveillance technologies that were purchased before the passage of the surveillance ordinance.
Speaker 2: Our expectation is that correct me if I'm wrong, Councilmember Peterson, is that there are no future purchases of surveillance technology moving forward because we want to the expectation is that we will have three or four kinds of policies as a requirement to permit the purchase.
Speaker 2: But we don't have that opportunity with things that were already purchased.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And as a.
Speaker 0: Follow up to that, maybe just to prompt or to confirm my my research as well, just because the department is using it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to authorize that. You've gone through the rigorous process in committee of evaluating the various questions and making sure that it conforms or that you have added the appropriate sideboards to
Speaker 0: make it align with the Council's the council's priorities. And thus it's not not just as a symptom of it being currently used and thus being authorized, but you have gone through this process with the robust input from the the committee whose name I'm forgetting right now to make sure that those questions have been answered.
Speaker 0: And then where there are additional side boards, you've worked on amendments and the Council also has the option to not authorize if we so deemed.
Speaker 3: Not.
Speaker 0: Necessary. Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were very thorough discussions at committee. We had at least two committee meetings on this.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, Councilmember Ms.. For your questions. Are there additional questions or comments on this item? Right. Seen done. Well, the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.

"<document> A chameleon balances carefully on a branch, waiting calmly for its prey... except that if you look closely, you will see that this picture is not all that it seems. For the 'creature' poised to pounce is not a colourful species of lizard but something altogether more human. Featuring two carefully painted female models, it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion. It is the work of Italian artist Johannes Stoetter. Scroll down for video . Can you see us? Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like a chameleon . The 37-year-old has previously transformed his models into frogs and parrots but this may be his most intricate and impressive piece to date. Stoetter daubed water-based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect, then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon. To complete the deception, the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them. Stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it. Speaking about The Chameleon, he said: 'I worked about four days to design the motif bigger and paint it with colours. 'The body painting took me about six hours with the help of an assistant. 'I covered the hair with natural clay to make the heads look bald. Camouflage job: A few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation . 'There are different difficulties on different levels as in every work, but I think that my passion and love to my work is so big, that I figure out a way to deal with difficulties. 'My main inspirations are nature, my personal life-philosophy, every-day-life and people themselves. However, the finished result existed only briefly before the models were able to get up and wash the paint off – with just a video and some photographs to record it. The artist added:   'I think that body painting is a good way to learn to let something go, to separate from something. That happens again and again in life and it is good to be able to handle with it. 'Also the fast end of the artwork makes us perceive it in a much more intensive way.' But there is one way in which the chameleon can still claim to be the unchallenged master of disguise. Unlike the real thing, Stoetter's models can't change their colour – unless he gets his paintbrush out. </document> <Summary> Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like a chameleon .

Whereas the housing authority of the city of Alameda was established on August 8th, 1940, to serve the affordable housing needs of the city of Alameda. And. WHEREAS, The Housing Authority initially met the needs of the Alameda community by constructing and managing over 5000 units to serve the military and or
Speaker 0: industry workers during World War Two. And. Whereas, 75 years later, the Housing Authority continues to serve the needs of the community as the property owner of over 700 affordable rental housing units, and by assisting approximately 1700 households through the Section eight Housing Choice Voucher program.
Speaker 0: And. WHEREAS, The Housing Authority adds to the financial well-being of the community through housing assistance payments to property owners, which exceed 20 million annually. And. WHEREAS, The Housing Authority furthers the city of Alameda, its mission to increase affordable rental and homeownership opportunities by producing more affordable units.
Speaker 0: Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Treasurer Spencer, Mayor of the City of Alameda, do hereby proclaim September 1st, 2015, as Housing Authority Appreciation Day in the city of Alameda and ask others to join me in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Housing Authority and recognizing its many years of service to Alameda residents.

#Person2#: Oh, I didn't actually teach in the schools. I taught after school. I taught in English institutes.
#Person1#: But you taught children, yes?
#Person2#: Yes. That's right. But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America. At least as far as studying is concerned. Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school.
#Person1#: They actually study after school?
#Person2#: That's right. After their school day is over, they go to a special institute to study math or English. They are very serious about learning over there.
#Person1#: Hmm. That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids. Don't they ever relax?
#Person2#: Of course they do. You know, Eliza, before I went over there I thought the same thing. I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much. But now that I've worked there, and taught them, I feel it is a good thing. Their parents are very concerned about their education. More than American parents are. And that is good. American kids don't study enough.
#Person1#: Asian cultures value learning very much. I know that.
#Person2#: So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education. They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing. In America, too many parents don't pay attention.
#Person1#: But aren't the kids tired out? I mean, they go to school all day, and then they go to school in the evening too.
#Person2#: As an English teacher, I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible. I tried to have a good time with my classes. The students often enjoyed it. And if the students enjoyed it, they learned more. So it was a good experience.
#Person1#: Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient?
#Person2#: That's a stereotype we Americans have. We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet. But it's not true. There are plenty of naughty kids too.
#Person1#: Hmm. I know you taught in Costa Rica also. Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan?

"<document> When state legislatures pass drug court acts or related legislation authorizing this noncarceral drug court approach, the effect is to bypass political barriers to more explicit decriminalization and to lend democratic legitimacy to drug courts’ efforts.227 Reentry courts may also operate on a decarceration model. Parole or probation violators constitute approximately 50–65% of people admitted to state prison, and about half of these individuals are re-incarcerated for technical violations.228 Reentry courts may facilitate access to social services and employment and rely on those referral sources for notification of extremely concerning noncompliance but otherwise sharply limit reincarceration for technical violations.229 Although most domestic violence courts function on a judicial monitoring model of limited effectiveness and with substantial associated rights-eviscerating risks, domestic violence courts could shift to a decarceration model for certain cases arising from relatively less serious and less violent incidents. Alternative sentences could still be onerous and require, among other conditions, considerable financial support of and physical separation from the complainant. These provisions might better serve the interests of the complainant spouse than incarceration for short periods of a spouse who is the primary source of financial support for the family.230 Courts could also work to facilitate services for complainants—as do many domestic violence courts currently— particularly because the availability of alternative living arrangements, employment opportunities, or vocational or educational training may empower survivors of domestic violence to leave or transform abusive relationships and, hence, in the long-run reduce reoffending, re-arrests, and reincarceration. Sex offense courts are generally conceptualized primarily on a judicial monitoring model but could also shift to a decarceration model by identifying those individuals whose convictions are such that carceral sentencing seems unnecessary (for instance, individuals convicted on the basis of public urination, certain other forms of indecent exposure, or consensual sex with a person not significantly younger than the accused).231 In all of these separate specialized criminal court contexts, a decarceration model does not purport to be capable of solving the underlying problems. Instead, a decarceration model frees up resources that might be allocated to sectors better able to address relevant problems, even if the problems ultimately remain in some measure intractable, at least without further-reaching intervention. A decarceration model is minimalist in its mission as compared to competing criminal law reformist models, at least with regard to the degree of intervention taking place in the court itself. Empirical monitoring may establish the basis for transferring this framework outside the specialized courts context, facilitating farther-reaching transformative criminal law reform. Gradually, in an incremental experimentalist fashion, a decarceration model may begin to reform criminal law more broadly by working to address the compound problem of the criminal law’s relationship to social-order maintenance and the social conditions associated with targeted conduct, moving the regulation of certain matters outside criminal law administration to other sectors. In summary, the upshot of the Article’s analysis to this point is that if specialized criminal courts aim to begin to reduce harshness and brutality in criminal law administration and to limit reliance on criminal supervision and incarceration while addressing socially disruptive conduct, they should organize themselves predominantly on a diversionary, minimalist, experimental, sociologically oriented decarceration model. The therapeutic, judicial monitoring, and order maintenance models represent distinct criminal law reformist strategies that threaten to exacerbate rather than unwind existing problems in criminal law administration because they each possess inherent features that tend to increase reliance on criminal supervision and that may even expand incarceration— radically transforming the judicial role and diluting procedural protections more significantly than on a decarceration model, without generating other demonstrated desirable outcomes. The following Part will explore in more detail three criminal law reform strategies that courts adopting a decarceration model may set in motion. Part IV will address anticipated objections. </document> <Summary> When state legislatures pass drug court acts or related legislation authorizing this noncarceral drug court approach, the effect is to bypass political barriers to more explicit decriminalization and to lend democratic legitimacy to drug courts’ efforts.

"<document> Speaker 0: . We've talked a lot about affordable housing in these chambers, and we talk a lot about our most vulnerable residents are homeless and are low income residents. But we also have, you know, expressed our concern for middle income residents who can't afford to stay in Denver.
Speaker 0: This is one of those programs that is for those middle income, moderate income families who are interested in becoming homeowners. And so I just wanted to take a moment to make the public aware of what this is. The mortgage credit certificate basically allows you to get a credit on your federal taxes up to 30% of the interest
Speaker 0: that you spent in a year. So everybody across the United States, under current rules, gets to deduct interest payments from their income. It lowers your income and therefore lowers your tax liability. This program allows you dollar for dollar to deduct from your actual tax payment.
Speaker 0: So if you owe the IRS $500 and you are going to get, you know, a $100 credit from your interest payment, you get to take that off what you owe the IRS. So it's a really great program for helping to make homeownership work.
Speaker 0: Whether you put that 100 bucks back into a home repair or just making the next mortgage payment. So I wanted to just make sure folks know they can find out about it. On Denver Gov Dawgs search for mortgage credit certificate and it is mostly for home first time homebuyers, although you can also receive it if you're in
Speaker 0: a targeted area that's a little bit distressed in our city or for some veterans. And the income limits are are really for those middle income families all the way up to $95,000 a year for two to adult household.
Speaker 0: So it really does help folks in that bracket buy homes in Denver. And it's actually out of funds right now. So we're really, really thanking my colleagues for their anticipated vote in support of this to keep helping homeowners buy homes in Denver.

"<document> As described in DOE’s September 2020 report, “U.S. Oil and Natural Gas: Providing Energy Security and Supporting Our Quality of Life”, oil and natural gas play an essential role in modern life that extends beyond the commonly associated transportation fuel, home heating and electricity generation. 73 Oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are the foundational elements and raw materials in manufacturing a range of consumer products, including plastic goods. Especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are key raw materials in the manufacture of plastic medical supplies and personal protective equipment like masks, ventilators, vaccine vials, and syringes. Further, fertilizers that increase annual crop yields are produced from dry natural gas, and lightweight modern plastics that increase fuel economy and vehicle safety are produced from natural gas liquids. The surge in U.S. oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production has given domestic manufacturers a competitive advantage, reducing key input costs to manufacture everyday goods. Yet, in a hydraulic fracturing ban scenario, this key American manufacturing advantage would be greatly diminished, setting back advancements made in domestic manufacturing. In fact, with oil and natural gas intertwined throughout virtually all aspects of the economy, the consequences of reduced production would reverberate throughout the U.S. and global economy. While a ban on hydraulic fracturing would directly and negatively impact oil and natural gas sector jobs, broader, less apparent consequences could exist in developing hydrogen-based energy, public and higher education funding, and even wind and solar development. </document> <Summary> As described in DOE’s September 2020 report, oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are the foundational elements and raw materials in manufacturing a range of consumer products, including plastic goods.
