Debate,"TO JUDGE by the doom-laden prophecies cascading in from Washington, the United States faces a towering and imminent threat in the form of the militant group calling itself the Islamic State, or ISIS. “They are coming here,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina intoned on Fox News Sunday. “I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists’ ability to operate in Syria and Iraq.” Senator Graham’s friend Senator John McCain is no less alarmist. Calling for immediate air strikes in Iraq and Syria, he declared, “They are getting stronger all the time . . . And their goal . . . is destruction of the United States of America.” Stoking the panic has been a very excitable press. On CNN last week, I was asked if Islamic State fighters represented an “existential threat” to the United States. Set aside that absurdity; no terrorist group threatens our existence. (America has faced one existential threat in modern times — the Soviet nuclear arsenal — and that is it.) But is the Islamic State a huge and menacing terrorist threat? Certainly not to the United States today. The danger to Iraq and its neighbors is real. The Islamic State has shown itself to be a formidable insurgency. Its focus is on ripping apart Iraq and Syria, sowing sectarian conflict, and creating in its midst a new jihadist state or caliphate. (That very word seems to incite fearmongers: “Every day that goes by, ISIS builds up its caliphate, and it becomes a direct threat to the United States,” said New York Representative Peter King, conjuring an image of a new Golden Horde with nuclear-tipped scimitars.) If the insurgency grows, and the threat to Jordan or Lebanon increases, we may have to act. But, for now, it’s important to understand that even if marauding operatives in Land Cruisers may be humiliating Iraq’s hollowed-out military, that doesn’t mean they have genuine terrorist skills. Consider the details: The Islamic State has never carried out a significant attack outside of its neighborhood. In 2005, when its operatives were still part of Al Qaeda in Iraq, operatives carried out hotel bombings in Jordan and tried and failed to attack an American warship in the Red Sea. More recently, four people were killed in an apparent lone-wolf attack at the Jewish museum in Brussels by a young man trained in Syria. In other words, we’ve seen no demonstrated ability to carry out the kind of complex international strike that kills dozens or hundreds, let alone engulfs a US city in flames. That is not to say Islamic State militants couldn’t develop those capabilities. As I wrote on this page in June, a vast ungoverned area has opened up in Syria and Iraq, opening up more space for terrorism to thrive. Additionally, the Islamic State’s cause has attracted foreign fighters from Europe and, in small numbers, America. Those are the people to worry about, since they have useful passports and the ability to operate in the West. What’s more, the group appears to be attracting attention from other jihadist organizations. Possibly the greatest risk today continues to be from Yemen, home to the same bomb makers who armed a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, with a hard-to-detect explosive sewn into his underwear and put him on a 2009 flight bound for Detroit. If these technicians join forces with the Islamic State, the threat level will go up markedly. These risks, however, don’t argue for abandoning the administration’s current targeted strategy in Iraq and instead launching a wide-ranging air campaign. To begin with, bombing insurgent formations isn’t going to reduce terrorism. The cells to worry over aren’t headed toward Erbil or Baghdad. More importantly, to deal with a terrorist group like the Islamic State requires local partners, and those partners will have to be Iraqis. That’s why it is vital that a new government is formed in Baghdad with a renewed effort at inclusiveness among Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds. As the White House recognizes, if that effort fails, and the sectarianism persists, Iraq will disintegrate. And if the United States takes ownership of fighting the Islamic State, Iraq’s common security problem, there’d be little incentive for cooperation. Ultimately, a more fearsome civil war will occur, and the danger to the West will expand exponentially. Terrorists thrive in conflict zones. Yes, we probably have a confrontation with the Islamic State — a group with a desire to kill Americans in its DNA — in our future. It’s a good bet that within a year or two, there will be extensive American intelligence operations throughout Iraq, and US drones flying its skies. As we head toward that eventuality, however, we should remember the critical advances (despite Edward Snowden) in US intelligence gathering since 9/11. We can’t stop every solo operative who gets his hands on a rifle or even gunpowder and ball bearings — but that reality doesn’t threaten our existence. And hysteria and missteps in the field aren’t going to make us safer.","TO JUDGE by the doom-laden prophecies cascading in from Washington, the United States faces a towering and imminent threat in the form of the militant group calling itself the Islamic State, or ISIS. “They are coming here,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina intoned on Fox News Sunday. “I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists’ ability to operate in Syria and Iraq.” Senator Graham’s friend Senator John McCain is no less alarmist.

News Article,"Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market. The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.","Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market.

News Article,"Graeme Finlay leaving Teesside Crown Court today. He is accused of attacking husband and wife Ronald and June Phillips while on board a cruise ship . After enjoying dinner, an evening show and a drink in the cruise ship’s cabaret bar, Ron and June Phillips headed to their cabin clutching cups of cocoa. But their relaxing night on the luxury liner was shattered by a violent confrontation that left both unconscious. The elderly couple were ambushed outside their room by a passenger who had earlier sat with them in the restaurant and claims that he was snubbed, a court heard yesterday. Graeme Finlay, 53, says he was ‘ignored’ when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu. He claims Mr Phillips, 70, later struck him with his crutch during a confrontation but the couple say they were ambushed. Mr Phillips and his 69-year-old wife were on a 14-night holiday based in the Canary Islands, which involved seven nights on the Thomson Celebration ship and seven nights in a hotel. Describing the horrific night in January last year – when the liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote – Mr Phillips told the court he had drunk about three gin and tonics when he and his wife headed back to their cabin. Mr Phillips walked with a crutch because of a hip replacement operation and his wife also suffered from limited mobility due to osteoarthritis. He told Teesside Crown Court that he was holding both cups of hot chocolate in one hand and his crutch in the other when they were set upon as they entered their room. Mr Phillips said he was about to follow his wife into the cabin when he spotted someone out of the corner of his eye. The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the frail, elderly pair . ‘The next thing I knew I came to with people all around me,’ he said. ‘There seemed to be blood everywhere and broken hot chocolate mugs. I only remember one punch to my head and I was knocked out.’ In her evidence, Mrs Phillips said: ‘I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof [she made a punching motion]. 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him, “leave him alone, you will kill him”.’ Prosecutor Lewis Kerr told the court that Mr Phillips suffered facial injuries. His wife was pushed against a wall and also knocked unconscious. She was found to have suffered two broken vertebrae. The crew of the Celebration found bed sheets and a T-shirt in Finlay’s cabin with blood marks. He was not on the ship, which was in port at the time of the discovery, but when he returned he was told to make his own way back to his home in Glasgow. Mr Kerr said: ‘The defendant was interviewed by the police and explained he had an argument with Mr and Mrs Phillips. ‘He accepts he hit Mr Phillips but didn’t accept causing the injuries to Mrs Phillips. He said he was only ever acting in self-defence.’ Teesside Crown Court, pictured, heard how crew members discovered a bloodstained T-shirt and bed sheets in Mr Finlay's cabin. He denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm . It was alleged that after dinner Finlay had shared a lift with Mr and Mrs Phillips and told them: ‘You ignored me, I want an apology.’ Peter Kilgour, defending, put it to Mr Phillips that he swore at the defendant and ‘lashed out at him’ with his crutch. Mr Phillips replied: ‘No. Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife, you can ask her.’ He said there was no row in the lift and that he was attacked without warning. He also denied snubbing Finlay at dinner, insisting: ‘I wouldn’t ignore someone who had sat down at my table. We were in the restaurant for 45 minutes to an hour and didn’t see him again. We just chatted to the other couple. There was no disagreement.’ Finlay denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm. The case continues.

News Article,"It's not something parking wardens are usually accused of... but some have been criticised for being too nice. An inspection in two Welsh towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets, letting many locals get away with parking offences. And their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a ‘free for all’. Inspectors in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements (file picture) The investigation was carried out by officials from Powys County Council, who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions. Powys council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even. Councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells and found there were plenty of infringements, but many were going unticketed. In one case, a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes, but the warden ‘still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket’. Officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas – even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’. Even when tickets were issued, 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’ (file picture) The investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation, including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued. They said wardens are currently leaving it ‘too long’, particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time. They also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across Powys as ‘decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations’. Some 5,000 tickets are issued in Powys, bringing in £1.2million a year, but the council is still subsidising the operation. The report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service ‘cost neutral’.","It's not something parking wardens are usually accused of... but some have been criticised for being too nice.

Debate,"It was not until the dawn of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954) that the underlying justification for institutional exclusion and segregation of Black students was broadly questioned as incompatible with the norms of liberal democracy. During this time, the university became one of the primary sites of struggle and social transformation. In “Black Study, Black Struggle,” Kelley recounts the rich tradition of Black studies as it emerged through the “mass revolt” of “insurgent intellectuals” committed to the development of “fugitive spaces” not just outside, but also in opposition to, the Eurocentric university. He cites the works of James Baldwin, Ella Baker, Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Barbara Smith, C. L. R. James, and Cedric Robinson, among others, as the “sources of social critique” that helped to inspire alternative spaces like the Mississippi Freedom Schools. The aim was not simply to offer a broader, more inclusive curriculum, but rather to design one that examined power along the axes of race and class, developing “trenchant critiques of materialism” that helped to challenge “the myth that the civil rights movement was just about claiming a place in mainstream society” (Kelley, 2016). The desire, as articulated by Kelley, was not for “equal opportunity in a burning house;” rather, “they wanted to build a new house.” But since the settler university can only “remove to replace,” it was not long before the revolutionary and redistributive aims of Black radicalism were supplanted by and absorbed within the political project of liberal pluralism, transposing the anti- capitalist critique with a politics of recognition. In other words, through the structures of settler logics, the demands of #ConcernedStudent1950 are only legible as the desire for recognition and more “intense inclusion” (Kelley, 2016). While demands for safe spaces, greater diversity, mental health counseling, curricular representation, and renamed campus buildings are hardly inconsequential, they also have the potential to function as inducements. Thus, just as recognition- based politics impede Indigenous struggles for decolonization, they also constrain efforts for more a radical vision for Black study and struggle within and against the university. In other words, the settler state has an array of strategies— recognition being one of them— to placate dispossessed people while evading any effort to change the underlying power structure. Despite all the handwringing by university officials, within the context of the liberal academy, discourses of recognition garner wide appeal as they provide a means for neatly bracketing what are fundamentally complex and ongoing sets of power relations. Such demands mark a definitive endpoint to a history of wrongdoing as well as a means for moving beyond that history (Corntassel & Holder, 2008). Consider, for example, the growing wave of colleges and universities seeking to reconcile their involvement in the slave trade. The University of Alabama (2004), the University of Virginia (2007), and Emory University (2011) have all issued formal apologies. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill erected a memorial, Washington and Lee removed all its confederate flags, and the College of William and Mary launched an investigation into its history of complicity. Brown University launched one of the most comprehensive projects that included a commissioned three- year study, an acknowledgement, a memorial, and an endowment for Providence public schools. While the symbolic importance of such projects should not be underestimated, they should also be understood as a first step toward restructuring material conditions. For example, consider that though it has been 15 years since the Brown study was launched, only 7.3% of their student body and 4% of its faculty are currently African- American. And, no institution to date has offered reparations.15 Nevertheless, recognition not only continues to serve as the dominant institutional framework for addressing structural racism but also, as noted by Kelley (2016, para. 7), student activists now parrot the discourses of recognition and thereby unwittingly participate in their own continued marginalization. A thematic analysis of the current compilation of student demands from across 70 institutions shows that 88% demanded either changes to curricula or diversity training (especially for faculty); 87% demanded more support for students of color (i.e., multicultural centers, residence halls, financial aid, mental health services); 79% demanded greater faculty diversity; and 24% desire apologies and acknowledgments. This breakdown suggests that the central organizing principal for demands is indeed the desire for a more “hospitable” institution. Yet, it isn’t so much the nature of the demands that Kelley takes issue with but rather their persistent framing through the discourses of personal trauma (emphasis in original) and the potential to “slip into” thinking about “ourselves as victims and objects rather than agents” (Kelley, 2016). In some instances, faculty have joined students, sometimes issuing their own demands for recognition. Most often, faculty demands are organized around issues of tenure, the exploitation of contingent faculty, and increasing violations of academic freedom, which disproportionately impact women and faculty of color.","It was not until the dawn of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954) that the underlying justification for institutional exclusion and segregation of Black students was broadly questioned as incompatible with the norms of liberal democracy.

The University of Alabama (2004), the University of Virginia (2007), and Emory University (2011) have all issued formal apologies. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill erected a memorial, Washington and Lee removed all its confederate flags, and the College of William and Mary launched an investigation into its history of complicity. Brown University launched one of the most comprehensive projects that included a commissioned three- year study, an acknowledgement, a memorial, and an endowment for Providence public schools. While the symbolic importance of such projects should not be underestimated, they should also be understood as a first step toward restructuring material conditions. For example, consider that though it has been 15 years since the Brown study was launched, only 7.3% of their student body and 4% of its faculty are currently African- American. And, no institution to date has offered reparations.15 Nevertheless, recognition not only continues to serve as the dominant institutional framework for addressing structural racism but also, as noted by Kelley (2016, para. 7), student activists now parrot the discourses of recognition and thereby unwittingly participate in their own continued marginalization. A thematic analysis of the current compilation of student demands from across 70 institutions shows that 88% demanded either changes to curricula or diversity training (especially for faculty); 87% demanded more support for students of color (i.e., multicultural centers, residence halls, financial aid, mental health services); 79% demanded greater faculty diversity; and 24% desire apologies and acknowledgments. This breakdown suggests that the central organizing principal for demands is indeed the desire for a more “hospitable” institution. Yet, it isn’t so much the nature of the demands that Kelley takes issue with but rather their persistent framing through the discourses of personal trauma (emphasis in original) and the potential to “slip into” thinking about “ourselves as victims and objects rather than agents” (Kelley, 2016). In some instances, faculty have joined students, sometimes issuing their own demands for recognition. Most often, faculty demands are organized around issues of tenure, the exploitation of contingent faculty, and increasing violations of academic freedom, which disproportionately impact women and faculty of color. ","It was not until the dawn of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954) that the underlying justification for institutional exclusion and segregation of Black students was broadly questioned as incompatible with the norms of liberal democracy. 
During this time, the university became one of the primary sites of struggle and social transformation. 
In “Black Study, Black Struggle,” Kelley recounts the rich tradition of Black studies as it emerged through the “mass revolt” of “insurgent intellectuals” committed to the development of “fugitive spaces” not just outside, but also in opposition to, the Eurocentric university.  
The desire, as articulated by Kelley, was not for “equal opportunity in a burning house;” rather, “they wanted to build a new house.” 
But since the settler university can only “remove to replace,” it was not long before the revolutionary and redistributive aims of Black radicalism were supplanted by and absorbed within the political project of liberal pluralism, transposing the anti- capitalist critique with a politics of recognition. 
While demands for safe spaces, greater diversity, mental health counseling, curricular representation, and renamed campus buildings are hardly inconsequential, they also have the potential to function as inducements. 
Thus, just as recognition- based politics impede Indigenous struggles for decolonization, they also constrain efforts for more a radical vision for Black study and struggle within and against the university.
In other words, the settler state has an array of strategies— recognition being one of them— to placate dispossessed people while evading any effort to change the underlying power structure.

News Article,"Sorry: Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely (pictured) is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for Rolling Stone magazine about campus rape . The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video .

Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.","Sorry: Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely (pictured) is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for Rolling Stone magazine about campus rape .

Debate,"As immigration talks resume, the public debate has once again zeroed in on the merits of granting some type of so-called amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants. But another, more complicated dispute – where the sides are equally entrenched – is brewing behind the scenes between organized labor and business interests. That debate, over how to manage future flows of legal immigration, particularly the size and scope of some kind of temporary worker program, could just as easily derail any type of immigration overhaul. Farmers from California to North Carolina say they need more temporary workers to grow and pick crops. Increased border enforcement has made it harder to fill crucial agriculture jobs. Plant managers in North Carolina and South Carolina, for example, have been forced to turn to prisons to man assembly lines at poultry plants. Farmers need more hands in the orchards picking nuts and fruits in California’s Central Valley and grapes at vineyards in Washington state’s Tri-Cities area. “The workers are not here,” said Manuel Cunha, president of the Fresno, Calif.-based Nisei Farmers League. “You got to have milkers. You don’t bring anyone out of the unemployment line to milk cows.” But labor unions are wary of expanding guest-worker programs, insisting on a path to citizenship and worrying about what they say are abuses of the guest-worker programs and unfair competition to American laborers. In North Carolina, growers have been able to harvest their crops thanks to about 7,500 foreign workers employed by farmers through the federal H-2A temporary visa program. The program brings foreign agriculture workers in for months at a time, pays wages for their labor and sends the workers home until the next season. In all, about 70,000 workers were hired through the H-2A program last year. The program is widely criticized by farmers as cumbersome and expensive. Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, advocates for revamping the program to make it more cost effective and easier to use. He said Americans simply do not want to do the back-breaking work picking fruits and vegetables. “We had 270 U.S. applicants apply for 7,500 openings,” Wicker said of this year. Talks on developing comprehensive immigration legislation resumed this month after Latino voters overwhelmingly supported President Barack Obama for another term. Republican leaders, mindful of the electorate’s demographic changes, now say they’re willing to discuss some type of path to legalization for some of the estimated 11 million people who are living in the United States illegally. But in return, they say, border security must be improved and Democrats have to stand up to unions and support an expanded guest-worker program, including some non-agriculture jobs, in order to prevent future waves of mass illegal immigration. Some fear that a path to legal status without an accompanying worker program would lure more undocumented immigrants into the United States. “There is so much agreement on border security, employment verification,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told McClatchy. “It breaks down on the number of guest workers. Unions hate that, but we have to have it. And the 12 million is a problem for the Republicans. We have to find some common ground.” A similar dispute, Republicans say, helped derail the Senate’s 2007 comprehensive immigration bill. Then, an amendment was introduced that would have phased out a new program to increase the number of temporary workers. Republicans saw the temporary worker program as a critical compromise to limit future waves of illegal immigration.","As immigration talks resume, the public debate has once again zeroed in on the merits of granting some type of so-called amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants.

Debate,"We humans need food for proper nutrition. In times of crisis, access to a stable food supply is the key to continued survival. In the presence of natural disasters, human conflicts, climate change, and overpopulation, the threat of food shortages and total famine is not as far-fetched as it seems. Preparing long-term food supplies can buffer the effects of these potential catastrophes. The Anatomy of a Catastrophe Many people think that food shortages may be a thing of the past. Thanks to the marvels of modern technology and scientific farming methods, we have a constant and abundant supply of food. It is difficult to imagine how a food shortage can happen – but it is still a possibility. During ancient times, humans hunted and gathered for food. Then a revolution occurred and changed the course of history: we learned how to cultivate the soil, plant crops, and domesticate animals for a stable source of food. Eventually, modern technology has improved farming and fishing techniques, that food production has now become large-scale. People now depend on hard-working farmers and fishermen for their everyday supply of food. But what happens when the harvests are poor? The farmer will keep his produce to feed his own family first – other people are left without food. Such scenario is still possible today because there are man-made disasters and natural calamities that threaten the world’s food supply. For example, a hurricane rages across the country and floods several states. Our access to food is restricted because travel is nearly impossible. To add to that, business establishments like groceries and supermarkets are probably closed down due to the flood as well as a power outage. Some might argue that this is not a real food shortage scenario because the problem is merely logistics: there is food; it is just that we have no access to it. It is true that natural calamities and wars cause a food shortage only temporarily. However, recent studies show that at present, we consume more than we produce. The UN warns that grain reserves are progressively getting lower because of droughts and crop failures in major food producing countries. The famine in Africa may possibly be felt in other parts of the world. This is an emergency situation that requires us to prepare beforehand. We must have a supply of food and water for us to survive.","We humans need food for proper nutrition.

Debate,"Some proponents of economic integration in North America have maintained that the emergence of China and India in the global marketplace may be putting North America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and that NAFTA should go beyond a free trade agreement. Some observers have proposed that the U.S. government consider the possibility of forming a customs union or common market.63 However, critics of this level of economic integration believe that NAFTA has already gone too far and that it has harmed the U.S. and Mexican economies and undermined democratic control of domestic policy-making.64 If the United States were to potentially consider the further economic integration in North America, it would require cooperation by the governments of Mexico and Canada, and approval by the U.S. Congress. Expanding NAFTA to a customs union or common market is not likely to happen within the foreseeable future. A possible option to address Mexico’s income disparities with the United States is to consider expanding the mandate of the North American Development Bank (NADBank). NADBank and its sister institution, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), were created under a bilateral side agreement to NAFTA called the Border Environmental Cooperation Agreement. The objective of NADBank and BECC is to help U.S.-Mexico border communities plan and finance environmental infrastructure projects. Some Members of Congress and elected officials from Mexico have informally discussed the possibility of expanding the mission of the NADBank to go beyond environmental and border issues. One possibility would be to expand NADBank projects to include transportation and other types of infrastructure projects. Another option would be to expand eligible projects to the entire region of Mexico instead of just the border area. Some policymakers have suggested the possibility of creating an infrastructure fund that would be managed by NADBank to provide investment in infrastructure, communications, or education.","Some proponents of economic integration in North America have maintained that the emergence of China and India in the global marketplace may be putting North America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and that NAFTA should go beyond a free trade agreement.

News Article,"A man killed more than 1,000 dogs in Russia  as revenge as he believed the strays were responsible for giving him tuberculosis, a trial heard. Danila Kislitsyn told police  it was his duty to eliminate dogs from the streets around Vladivostok as they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out. The 31-year-old would travel around the south-eastern Russian city using poisoned sausages and setting traps to kill  strays and occasionally even people's pets. Danila Kislitsyn (pictured at his trial) has been found guilty of killing 1,000 dogs by giving them poisoned sausages . Officials heard the attacks were revenge as he blamed the animals for him contracting tuberculosis several years previously which had left him in a weakened state. He was arrested as part of a campaign by animal-rights activists who had spent two years monitoring Kislitsyn who would sometimes kill as many as a dozen dogs a day. Kislitsyn had to be sent for psychiatric tests ahead of the trial but was found fit to stand. But animal charities were furious when Judge Olga Yerokhina handed Kislitsyn a fine of just £200. The trial heard that Kislitsyn, pictured with a police officer at his trial, claimed it was his duty to eliminate stray dogs from the streets saying they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out . Judge Olga Yerokhina sentenced the 31-year-old, who also believed dogs were to blame for him contracting tuberculosis, to pay just £200 for the canine genocide . Activist Sarah Pirogova from the charity Animal Defender said: 'He was responsible for a dog genocide in his neighbourhood, sometimes a dozen bodies of dead dogs could be spotted on the streets in single day. 'He says he only targeted strays but very often people's pets were also poisoned after eating a piece of sausage that he had laced with poison.' Activists tested the sausages and found that not only were they poisoned, they also contained tablets designed to stop the dogs vomiting so that they could not throw up the lethal food. She added: 'We tried to confront him about it but he was extremely violent and would use spray before running off, so we finally decided to hand a report to police. 'We are disappointed with the result but hope that he will not want to pay another fine and will now stop what he has been doing.'","A man killed more than 1,000 dogs in Russia  as revenge as he believed the strays were responsible for giving him tuberculosis, a trial heard.

News Article,"The Tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential Labour-SNP power-sharing deal by unveiling the party’s first ‘manifesto for England’. The Prime Minister and the outgoing Leader of the Commons William Hague will launch the English document, which follows traditional Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Its centrepiece will be a pledge to introduce a system of ‘English votes for English laws’ – giving English MPs an effective veto over legislation applying only to their constituents. Inflammatory: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) will be joined by William Hague (right) as they launch the English manifesto - with the latter expected to warn England risks being 'held to ransom' by SNP . Mr Hague is expected to warn that England risks being ‘held to ransom’ by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement such a reform. The manifesto is also expected to commit the Tories to dozens of new road schemes in England and an extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the English NHS. The document will be seen as an attempt by the Tories to tap into growing English nationalism. Opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the UK’s four nations. But a Tory strategist said: ‘We have separate Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Why shouldn’t there be one for England?’ The ‘English votes’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the Scottish Parliament is handed yet more powers. Mr Hague wants to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given Holyrood will soon control all these issues in Scotland. The reform would make it impossible for any future Labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Tensions: The manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the Tories and nationalist parties like Nicola Sturgeon's SNP and Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood . It could also make it difficult for a Scottish MP to again hold the office of Chancellor or Prime Minister, given they would be unable to vote on some of their own Government’s legislation. For decades, Labour has relied on the votes of its power base of Scottish MPs to rule Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Both reforms passed under Tony Blair’s government thanks to the votes of Labour’s tartan army of MPs. Mr Hague is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to Scotland means the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster is unavoidable. 'Calm smoothness': Cameron has insisted he has 'no end' of passion in an interview with The Spectator . David Cameron has admitted that what he called his ‘calm smoothness’ could give people the wrong impression about how urgently he wants to win the General Election. In an interview with The Spectator, the Prime Minister insisted he had ‘no end’ of passion but was a Conservative, a tribe of ‘practical, sensible, clear-headed’ people who ‘don’t always wear their beliefs on their sleeve’. Asked why many people believe he must do more to demonstrate that he really wants to win, he said: ‘I don’t know. There is something about me – I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something. ‘But look, yesterday, where was I? I went to five seats, I did five speeches, I didn’t finish until way after the other party leaders were home having TV training or something. 'I was out on the stump and I’m doing the same today. Look at my schedule! I don’t know what more I can do.’ Mr Cameron yesterday faced one of his most hostile interviews so far in the campaign. Chris Smith, a Radio 1 Newsbeat presenter, repeatedly interrupted him and offered him a £1,000 bet that he would not win the election outright. Clearly irritated, the Prime Minister said: ‘Have you got some God-given right to declare what the result of the election is?’ He insisted that ‘there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government’.","The Tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential Labour-SNP power-sharing deal by unveiling the party’s first ‘manifesto for England’.

Philippe Coutinho hit the only goal of the game as Liverpool advanced to the FA Cup semi-finals . Kolo Toure (left) embraces new father Jordan Henderson on a day to remember for the Liverpool captain . The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Henderson said: ‘Philippe has a great football brain. It’s the easy bit giving it to him. Another bit of brilliance wins the game and gives everyone a lift.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Henderson told him there was no chance he was missing the fixture once the baby had arrived.

Debate,"The ""Crypto Wars"" are here again, which means federal officials are doing all they can to limit the technological tools that keep our personal data secure. President Obama and leaders from the National Security Agency (NSA), FBI, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been pressuring the technology community to build ""backdoors"" that allow government access to encrypted data. The War on Terror provides plenty of rhetorical ammunition to these anti-encryption officials, who seem to believe that purposefully sabotaging our strongest defenses against ""cyberterrorists"" is an effective way to promote national security. But they are dangerously wrong, as recent revelations of decades-old security vulnerabilities imposed by encryption restrictions make all too clear. Encryption allows people to securely send data that can only be accessed by verified parties. Mathematical techniques convert the content of a message into a scrambled jumble, called a ciphertext, which looks like nonsense in electronic transit until it is decoded by the intended recipient. Simple ciphers have been used to secure communications since the days of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, when a particularly devoted scribe took to fancying up the tomb of Khnumhotep II with cryptic funeral prose. Our own Thomas Jefferson regularly used ciphers in communications with James Madison, John Adams, and James Monroe to ""keep matters merely personal to ourselves."" State military and research offices were the main 20th century beneficiaries of advanced encryption techniques until the development of public-key cryptography in the 1970s, which afforded commercial and private users a means to protect their data against unwanted infiltration. Now, what was once a mere means to share secrets has become an indispensable component of personal and national data security. An estimated 40 million cyberattacks occurred in 2014, imposing millions in costs and weeks of frustration for organizations and individual users alike. Many of these costly breaches could be prevented through encryption techniques that regulate data access, authenticate users, and secure sensitive information. A secret report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council—ironically, leaked by Edward Snowden thanks to the government’s own poor authentication practices—even made the case that encryption was the ""best defense"" to protect private data. Yet intelligence agencies and their allies have consistently set out to limit encryption technologies (many of which they developed or relied upon themselves previously). The seeds of the first Crypto Wars were sown during the Cold War, when the U.S. imposed strong export controls on encryption techniques to keep them away from the Ruskies. Only a small set of relatively weak techniques approved by the Commerce and State Departments could be used in international business. But this practice was dangerously self-defeating. Compelling foreign users to settle for weakened encryption standards ultimately made U.S. users more vulnerable by introducing unnecessary fragility.","The ""Crypto Wars"" are here again, which means federal officials are doing all they can to limit the technological tools that keep our personal data secure.

News Article,"Tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to a study of infants’ brains which overturns the medical consensus. Until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain. It means that newborns often go without painkillers, even during invasive procedures. But the new findings, revealed by Oxford University doctors, suggest that not only do babies feel pain, but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults. Scroll down for video . Research on infants’ brains by doctors from Oxford University has found that young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults. It overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold (file picture) In the first study of its kind, the researchers showed in brain scans that infants’ brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain. Dr Rebeccah  Slater, of Oxford’s department of Paediatrics, said: ‘Obviously babies can’t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations. ‘In fact some people have argued that babies’ brains are not developed enough for them to really “feel” pain, any reaction being just a reflex – our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case.’ The results, published in the journal eLife, suggest that it is possible to see pain ‘happening’ inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults. Up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving, but otherwise were given no pain medication. A landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions, and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations. But injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief, and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child’s pain. Even this year, NHS guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than ‘a cuddle’. Guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue-tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant’s tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed. The research, which was carried out by doctors from Oxford University (pictured) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers, even for invasive procedures . The NHS guidelines, updated in January 2015, advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth’s floor, infants do not need medication. Older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic, doctors are told. But the guidelines say: ‘In small babies, being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers.’ Dr Slater called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated. ‘Thousands of babies across the UK undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians,’ she said. ‘Our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults. ‘We have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.’ Her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old, and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years. MRI scans were taken of the babies’ brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil – mild enough that it did not wake them up. The researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults’ brains also ‘lit up’ in babies’ brains. Scans also showed that babies’ brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower. Dr Slater said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies. There are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream, with unknown consequences. ‘Finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required,’ she said.","Tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to a study of infants’ brains which overturns the medical consensus.

Meeting,"Speaker 1: So that's that's a pretty important parcel. So congratulations to everybody as part of that. Next up is in District eight, the final parcel tonight, 22.
Speaker 0: Item 22 is a report from Economic and Property Development and Development Services. Recommendation two Adopt specification for the purchase and development opportunity at 5550 100 Long Beach Boulevard. Declare the city on subject property as surplus and authorize city manager to execute all necessary documents with city ventures for the sale of the subject property in the amount of
Speaker 0: 2.5 million. District eight.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Staff Report.
Speaker 8: Michael Conway.
Speaker 7: Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council. The property located at 5100 Long Beach Boulevard at the northwest corner of East Home Street and Long Beach Boulevard is a vacant lot, containing 75,376 square feet, which is slightly over 1.7 acres in size.
Speaker 7: The property was categorized as future development long range property management plan, which properties are disposed through a request for proposal process. The city received three proposals submitted in response to the RFP and a review panel analyzed the three proposals from the perspective of best value for the city.
Speaker 7: The three proposals were somewhat similar in that they all proposed residential development. However, the density ranged from six density units per acre to 86 density units per acre. The submittals included single family homes for sale, townhomes for sale and workforce housing for for rent.
Speaker 7: One proposal did not offer a purchase price, although their sources and uses table indicated the land had a contribution value of $3 million. Of the three proposals, City Ventures LLC was unanimously selected by the review panel as offering the best value to the city.
Speaker 7: City Ventures offered the apparent highest price for the property and offered a medium density project that has a good likelihood of being supported by the adjoining single family residence and the nearby residential community. City Ventures development timeline is proposed to be 90 days for due diligence, an additional nine months for entitlement and closing 30 days thereafter.
Speaker 7: Construction is anticipated to take 18 months. Staff request some flexibility in the due diligence and entitlement time frame if unforeseen events occur that delayed the proposed timeline and with that staff request City Council adopt specifications number RFP PEP 16 Dash 001 for the purchase and development of 5100 Long Beach Boulevard.
Speaker 7: Declare the property surplus authorized city manager. Execute all documents necessary for the sale of the property to City Ventures, LLC for 2.5 million.
Speaker 8: And accept categorical.
Speaker 7: Exemption. S.E. 16 DASH 129. This concludes my report.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Braxton.
Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Mr. Conway and the entire staff for their work in helping to move this project along. I want to congratulate the City Ventures team for winning a competitive bid. There were two other proposals that they beat out for this this project, 42 market rate, condominium units.
Speaker 7: I think it's reasonable density and ample parking along a transit corridor. This is the project that we we're actually would love to see happen along Long Beach Boulevard. It's going to be a great addition and a dramatic improvement along the Long Beach Boulevard corridor.
Speaker 7: It will really upgrade our Virginia Village area. I did have a couple of just really quick questions. I know that particular property has two existing residential properties. I'm just almost connected to it. What do you foresee happening with those properties?

News Article,"Stan Collymore, talkSPORT lead football pundit who revels in laying down the law on the radio, astonished reporters with his behaviour during Aston Villa’s 3-3 Premier League draw with QPR on Tuesday night. Collymore, despite sitting in the Villa Park press box where media impartiality is taken for granted, was jumping up and down during the game like the most fanatical Villa fan, celebrating the goals with the home supporters. He even greeted QPR’s Joey Barton falling down to win a free-kick by clearly shouting at him: ‘You f****** rat.’ talkSport pundit Stan Collymore was in full fan mode as he celebrated Villa's 3-3 draw with QPR . The former Villa striker let loose with his wild, and sometimes expletive laden, comments from the press box . Villa fan Collymore believed such actions in the supposed neutral sanctuary of the press box were permissible as he wasn’t working for talkSPORT during the match. He tweeted: ‘With respect, on nights I go as a fan . . . I’m not being paid to do anything other than be a fan.’ And talkSPORT would not comment as they said Collymore wasn’t on duty, with reporter Nigel Pearson giving his rather more impartial verdict for the station. However Collymore did an interview with Adrian Durham and Darren Gough on talkSPORT before the match. Collymore called Joey Barton a 'f*****g rat' after he fell down to win a free-kick for QPR during the game . Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire’s highly-rated championship-winning coach also in charge of Big Bash team Adelaide Strikers, is hardly your archetypal red-meat-eating Aussie fast bowler. Gillespie, who would be first choice for England as well if Peter Moores fails in the West Indies, is preparing for new season by becoming a vegan. Meanwhile Lancashire’s supporters’ action group are questioning the value of having Sky Sports commentator Paul Allott on the club board after Peter Siddle, Lancashire’s overseas signing, was selected for Australia’s tours of the West Indies and England, ruling him out of any county involvement. Yorkshire's championship winning coach Jason Gillespie is preparing for the season with a new diet . Bookmakers Paddy Power, rabid publicists guaranteed to offend, have a new stunt showing Ruby Walsh supposedly preparing for the Grand National by jumping his horse over a speeding car. The YouTube video is plainly mocked up but, with sensitivities around animal welfare, it was crass of Walsh, jump racing’s pre-eminent jockey after AP McCoy’s forthcoming retirement, to involve himself in such a provocative spoof — even if he is a Paddy Power ambassador. Ruby Walsh and horse clear a car, claimed to be travelling at 40mph,  as part of the Grand National countdown . The split between FA chairman Greg Dyke and vice-chairman David Gill over homegrown players became very apparent during Wednesday's FA council meeting. After Dyke gave his well-received presentation, Manchester United director Gill, with his Premier League hat on, told council that Dyke should have said ‘I’ rather than ‘we’ as the issue had yet to be debated by the FA board. Gill wants the consultation period to be a proper process starting at board level — during which no doubt the Premier League will try to hijack it. So the big question is whether Dyke is willing to use the rulebook to force it through. FA chairman Greg Dyke still faces a challenge to convince everyone over plans to change homegrown quota .

Meeting,"Speaker 1: Motion carries unanimously of 13. Communication from Councilman Austin. Chair State Legislation Committee Recommendation to adopt. And support position as position SB 16 bill, a state proposal that will provide a new temporary funding source for state and local, street and road projects.
Speaker 0: Council Bros.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm pleased to bring before you an item from the State Legislation Committee, which we we supported in committee and encouraged your support as well. This is this bill we believe is going to be very good for Long Beach in terms of our infrastructure, addressing our important infrastructure needs.
Speaker 3: The League of California Cities has voted unanimously to support this particular bill, that it is a priority bill working its way through the state legislature. And essentially, in a nutshell, it will provide a windfall of resources for the city of Long Beach and many other municipalities, all of the municipalities throughout the state of California, as well as
Speaker 3: funding for local highways to the tune of a $3 billion raise over a five year period to Long Beach. That means a windfall of 50 to $60 million or 10 to $12 million a year for infrastructure needs. Currently, we contribute, I think, appropriate about $5 million a year toward infrastructure needs.
Speaker 3: So if this bill is successful in Sacramento, it will mean that we more than triple our infrastructure, our ability to address infrastructure needs, and we know we have them in every district in the city. And so with that, I want to ask for a staff report for Diana Ting and obviously ask for your full support on this
Speaker 3: . I'm going to make the motion.
Speaker 0: There's a motion. Can I get a second, please? Okay. Second, but Councilwoman Gonzalez.
Speaker 2: Mayor, members of the city council, Councilmember Austin covered most of the pertinent details about SB 16. It is a five year increase in an excise tax on gasoline and diesel, as well as an increase to the vehicle registration fee.
Speaker 2: And the funding, again, will fund local streets and roads as well as the state highway system and its for Long Beach assessment shows that we invest an average of $5 million a year in this in our local streets and roads.
Speaker 2: And as the bill is written now, we would be receiving about an extra 10 to 12 million a year that we wouldn't otherwise receive.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.
Speaker 5: Thank you. I want to speak to the community a little bit about how this bill actually really levels the playing field and helps put the tax burden of infrastructure on the people who are using it the most. I am one and several other of my colleagues who drive hybrid and electric and electric vehicles.
Speaker 5: And so this transition really allows the consumers of the most use of the road to take on an additional burden by leveling the playing field through not just gasoline tax, but really the VLF on the electric and hybrid vehicles.
Speaker 5: And while I am not supportive of higher taxes, I am supportive of correcting the taxation ratios to ensure that those who use the most are the ones who pay the most. And so I'll be supporting this idea.
Speaker 0: Councilor Austin.
Speaker 3: Thank you. I call for the question.
Speaker 0: I just want to just make one note before the council votes. Council member this, in my opinion, is going to be one of the top priorities for cities across the state of California this year. Quite frankly, we as a city and a community need to put our full weight behind getting this done in Sacramento.
Speaker 0: There are a lot of bills in the pipeline and probably very few that are more important for cities, in particular Long Beach, than the bill that's in front of us today. The truth is, is every time that we look at our at the bottom line in our budget and ask why we can't do more for infrastructure, why
Speaker 0: we can't get more streets and sidewalks built, why neighborhood streets are falling apart because we don't have the resources from both both Sacramento and Washington, DC. This is an attempt by Sacramento to give us some flexibility for a set number of years to be able to go after really significant infrastructure change.
Speaker 0: And so we're I know I personally am pretty excited about this. I intend to be in Sacramento often on this as I know well, our our committee our legislative committee in Sacramento as well. So I think this is very exciting legislation.
Speaker 0: And I want to thank Senator Bill as well as our state senator, Ricardo Lora, who is very active on this bill as well on on this issue. So I look forward to us being able to get this done and see a lot of dollars come back to Long Beach.
Speaker 0: Is there any public comment on this bill? CNN. Please cast your votes.
Speaker 1: Motion passes unanimously.

News Article,"A Transportation Security Administration agent who was fired in Nashville after becoming obsessed with a coworker - following her, taking videos and photos and breaking into her house five times - was jailed this week as a result of the stalking case. Daniel Boykin, 33, plead guilty to charges of unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. In apologizing for his actions in court Thursday, Boykin admitted to repeatedly filming the woman inside a bathroom at Nashville International Airport and was subsequently sentenced to six months prison. At the time of his arrest last year, Boykin was found with 92 videos of the victim — 29 taken from the airport bathroom — and 1,527 photographs. Investigators found additional images taken inside the woman's home of air vents and shelves in the bathroom, which they believe suggested he intended to plant hidden cameras at some point. Obsessed: Daniel Boykin, 33, a former TSA employee, appeared in court in Nashville on Thursday as he was sentenced to six months prison for stalking a colleague. More than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim were discovered on Boykin’s phone and computer, and he broke into her home five times . Disturbed: Boykin was sentenced Thursday for unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. He will be under strict probation for five years once he leaves prison, however will not be registered as a sex offender . He also took photos of her clothing and stole pictures from her electronic devices. The victim, who has not been named, came forward in May 2014. She told authorities that Boykin would watch her dog on the weekends. However when looking at some photos of the dog on his phone one day at work, the woman discovered a cache of photos of herself. 'I was sick to my stomach,' she told the court, according to WKRN. 'I am sure I was as white as these walls. 'So eventually I said I had a headache and had to go home.' Boykin also took to the stand  to say he was sorry. 'I have abused and broken a trust that I can never repair, and for that I am truly sorry,' he told the court. The detective in the case, Andrew Vallee, said he as truly shocked during the investigation. Arrest: Police began investigating Boykin on May 30, 2014, after the U.S. Attorney's Office forwarded a complaint filed by the victim. She came forward after observing videos of herself on Boykin's phone. He was arrest after a search warrant was served at his Nashville apartment . 'This was one of the worst cases I have seen in terms of invading somebody's privacy in their most intimate moments and the most secure place, her home,' the detective told The Tennessean. 'My biggest disappointment in terms of justice was that under current law, (Boykin) doesn't have to register as a sex offender. 'Because my main motivation for justice is reducing the possibility that he will ever do this again to anyone else.' On top of the six months in prison, the sentence includes more than five years of probation with strict supervision and GPS monitoring. The judge also emphasized that Boykin should continue seeking mental health treatment.","A Transportation Security Administration agent who was fired in Nashville after becoming obsessed with a coworker - following her, taking videos and photos and breaking into her house five times - was jailed this week as a result of the stalking case.

Debate,"Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson’s (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland’s (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that ’future expectation of trade’ is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg & Hess, 2002. p. 89) Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, & Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. “Diversionary theory” suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a ’rally around the flag’ effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.","Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict.

","Political science literature has examined how economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict at systemic, dyadic, and national levels.
At the systemic level, economic crises could cause a redistribution of power that leads to conflict.
Dyadic trade expectations theory suggests crises that decrease trade expectations between states can increase conflict.
National level theories link economic decline to increased internal conflict and terrorism, which can spill across borders.
Economic decline also reduces government popularity, which can incentivize leaders to divert attention through external conflicts.
Recent scholarship links economic integration to more crises and economic decline to conflict, but this connection has received little attention.","Sent 1: Political science literature has examined how economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict at systemic, dyadic, and national levels.

News Article,"(CNN)The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on Houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa -- and supporters of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The resolution ""raises the cost"" for the Houthis, according to Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations. In addition to the arms embargo, it also demands that the Shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism, according to Grant. Russia abstained from Tuesday's vote, saying it didn't like the inclusion of sanctions. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition that is conducting airstrikes on targets associated with Saleh's supporters and the Houthis, who have emerged as Yemen's most dominant force in recent months. Also Tuesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Saudi Arabian Minister of Defense Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz agreed to form a joint military commission to discuss the implementation of a major strategic maneuver inside Saudi Arabia, Egypt's state-run Ahram news agency reported. Egypt announced that it would dispatch several naval ships to help halt the rebels' advance. In response to media reports, Egyptian officials said no troops have yet been sent to Yemen. The Houthis forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. They include Yemen's current ambassador to the United Nations, Khaled Mahfoodh Abdulla Bahah, who said Tuesday, ""We refuse (the) influence of Iran in Yemen affairs.""

Meeting,"Speaker 1: The report of the City Council Agenda one clerk 5314415 2019 State of the City address delivered by Mayor Jenny Durkan on February 19th, 2019.
Speaker 0: Just one moment. So this is a just sort of a perfunctory filing of the file, the speech, if you will, and I believe we will vote on it. And we'll place the file on the file before we vote on filing the clerk file.
Speaker 0: But anyone wish to say any words? No regrets council members want.
Speaker 2: Thank you, President Hollande. Just wanted to explain to members of the public that the vote the council is about to take will file into the city's records, the mayor's State of the City address. And of course, it should be on record.
Speaker 2: So I will be voting yes, but my vote will not be a vote on the content of the speech. However, and I wanted to bring to light something that the mayor said that was, in my view, dangerously inaccurate.
Speaker 2: Three times in his speech, Mayor Durkan said that Seattle has invested over $710 million in affordable housing during her time in office, adding, however, compare that while the claim to what it actually says in her budget, in the mayor's budget, it lists the funds that she has made available to build affordable housing.
Speaker 2: It is, and this can be verified by council members. It is less than $50 million per year, not 710 million. And as a matter of fact, if the political establishment was actually willing to spend $710 million on building affordable housing instead of under 50 million, then we could actually begin to seriously address the affordable housing crisis.
Speaker 2: The problem is that when the mayor exaggerates the investment in affordable housing, it sounds like it is not necessary to tax big business to build affordable housing on a scale big enough to have a real impact. But that would be wrong.
Speaker 2: In reality, the mayor is not investing 710 million. Really. She is investing less than 1% of the city budget in affordable housing. And regular people will need to continue to get organized to build a movement, to build anything close to affordable housing worth $710 million.
Speaker 2: And let's remember that ordinary people in New York City just won a massive victory against Amazon in its attempt to get a $3 billion corporate handout, including a helipad for Jeff Bezos. It really shows that when people get organized, we can win.
Speaker 2: This was assumed to be a done deal by everybody, including business owners, who were surprised by the fact that Amazon had to back off. So I will be voting yes on filing this Clark file, but I do not endorse her false claim about investment in affordable housing.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you for those words, Councilmember. What would anyone else like to say anything before we file the Clark file? And for the viewing public, this is a public document. The facts are, I believe that Councilmember Swan was referring to our Page seven of the published document and I personally wanted to thank the Mayor for giving a speech

Speaker 0: sure that we're using the right filters to reach our communities were intended to do. And and that would be a good opportunity to sort of reset, if we will, how these awards are done. I think we're doing a great job of always improving those.

News Article,"Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video . Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital . Mother Stacy Maitai had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time . The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk . About 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia . PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.' The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complication . Ms Maitai said she was heartbroken when she learnt about her son's condition . A fundraising page was set up to help the struggling family on mycause , so far raising more than $18,000 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai (left) and at home her seven-year-old daughter Serenity (right) The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll. The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include: global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples.","Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital.

News Article,"Joe Root admitted pitches like the one in Grenada make it easier to make centuries and harder to win games, as West Indies batted themselves into a position of relative comfort on day four of the second Test. Regardless of the state of the wicket, Root was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session, his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark. But for the second match in a row England's hopes of pushing for victory were railroaded by a dead pitch that was arguably better for run-making than on day one. Joe Root hits another ball to the boundary on his way to an impressive big hundred in Grenada . Root admitted that the flat pitch made it too easy to score runs and too tough to take wickets . Root's efforts left the West Indies with a 165-run deficit, but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps. Speaking after the match, Root lifted the lid on the tourists' frustrations. 'These pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as Test cricket is concerned, it's not ideal,' he said. 'Unfortunately, it's a very unresponsive pitch and it's been hard work . 'We all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done, but unfortunately it hasn't happened. 'This is what we've got to deal with, and we've just got to get on the best we can.' Stuart Broad, who eventually took the wicket of Darren Bravo, found the going tough in Grenada . Ben Stokes sees the ball disappear to the boundary once again as England struggled on day four . In all likelihood, the destiny of the game will be decided in the morning. England are five overs away from a new ball - which has been the only bankable way of making things happen - and must make it count with a cluster of wickets to set themselves for success. 'We're going to need a very good first hour in the morning,' he said. 'With the new ball we'll need a couple of early wickets and you never know. They're only 40 ahead, so if it's bang bang in the morning we've got a game on our hands. 'That would definitely give us the best chance of winning the game on a very flat wicket. 'Our only chance is wickets with the new ball, whether it be with seam or spin, that's the way it looks at the moment, but you never know.' Root admitted that England need early wickets with the new ball, just as James Anderson achieved on day four . West Indies go in to the final morning with Kraigg Brathwaite on 101 not out having compiled a dogged fourth Test ton and England's tormentor-in-chief Marlon Samuels alongside. Samuels, who memorably saluted Ben Stokes after his dismissal on the third evening, was not sledged when he arrived at the crease but Root had no guarantees that would continue. 'Everyone was very well behaved tonight, there was no-one speaking up,' he added. 'We'll see how tomorrow goes. Concentration might come into it, and maybe a bit of banter could spice things up a bit.'","Joe Root admitted pitches like the one in Grenada make it easier to make centuries and harder to win games, as West Indies batted themselves into a position of relative comfort on day four of the second Test.

Debate,"With the WikiLeaks hacks and other threats to cybersecurity present, guarding against cyberattacks has become a significant part of governing -- especially because most government agencies have moved to online systems. As a potential government shutdown comes closer, agencies must face new questions about defining “essential” computer personnel. Cyber threats weren’t as significant during the 1995 furlough as they are today, reports NextGov. The publication adds that agencies need to buck up and be organized. In late January, government officials, NATO and the European Union banded together in Brussels to formulate a plan to battle cyber bandits, according to Defense Systems. Leaders there agreed that existing cybersecurity measures were incomplete and decided to fast-track a new plan for cyber incident response. Meanwhile, observers are wondering whether the U.S. government has a plan to deal with cyberattacks in the case of a shutdown. The lists of essential computer security personnel drawn up 15 years ago are irrelevant today, computer specialists told NextGov. In 1995, the only agencies concerned about cybersecurity were entities such as the FBI and CIA. Today, before any potential government shutdown happens, a plan of essential IT personnel should be determined, the specialists add. Agencies should be figuring out which systems will need daily surveillance and strategic defense, as well as evaluating the job descriptions of the people operating in those systems, former federal executives told NextGov. Hord Tipton, a former Interior Department CIO, agrees. “If they haven’t done it, there’s going to be a mad scramble, and there’s going to be a hole in the system,” he told the site. All government departments are supposed to have contingency plans on deck that spell out essential systems and the employees associated with them, according to federal rules. Meanwhile, some experts say determining which IT workers are essential depends more on the length of the shutdown. Jeffrey Wheatman, a security and privacy analyst with the Gartner research group, tells NextGov that a shutdown lasting a couple of weeks “would require incident response personnel, network administrators and staff who monitor firewall logs for potential intrusions.” If a shutdown lasted a month or longer, more employees would need to report, he said, adding: “New threats could emerge during that time frame, which demands people with strategy-oriented job functions to devise new lines of defense.” Employees who are deemed “essential” are critical to national security. Cyber warfare or holes in cybersecurity can threaten a nation’s infrastructure. In particular, the electric grid, the nation’s military assets, financial sector and telecommunications networks can be vulnerable in the face of an attack, reports Federal Computer Week.","With the WikiLeaks hacks and other threats to cybersecurity present, guarding against cyberattacks has become a significant part of governing -- especially because most government agencies have moved to online systems.

Debate,"The Judge also sent a strong message as to the hurdle the DOJ would have to overcome regarding air travel: “The right to travel here and abroad is an important constitutional right. To deny this right to a citizen . . . based on inaccurate information without an effective means of redress would unconstitutionally burden the right to travel. While the Constitution does not ordinarily agree the right to travel by any particular form of transportation, given that other forms of travel usually remain possible, the fact remains that for international travel, air transport in these modern times is practically the only form of transportation, travel by ship being prohibitively expensive or so it will be presumed at the pleading stage.” This isn’t exactly new, as so eloquently stated in Kent v. Dulles (1958): “The right to travel is a part of the ‘liberty’ of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.

For four years, she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around Saudi Arabia's prohibition on foreign journalists. Her work appeared under the pseudonym Michael Collins. As she chronicled what was happening around her, Mackey's distinctive voice began to emerge. Over the years, a stream of books followed. ""The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom"" offered ""a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of Saudi social and public life,"" The New York Times wrote. Her 1992 book ""Passion and Politics: The Turbulent World of the Arabs"" helped bridge gaps in understanding between Arabs and Americans, critics wrote. Mackey wrote for the people she knew, in a layman's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher. ""Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans,"" Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal. After earning a history degree from the University of Central Oklahoma, Mackey attended the University of Virginia to study international relations. She graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program. For her book on Iran, Mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied, allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change. Her 2002 book ""The Reckoning -- Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein"" portended some of the outcomes of the war in Iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism. ""If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf,"" Mackey wrote in the book. ""We will be sucked into the resentments of the Arab world, the hostilities of the Iraqis, and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of American vital interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.'' Fouad Ajami, the late Hoover Institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on CNN, took issue with the book. ""The crowds in Baghdad and Basra (like the crowds in Kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music) may yet embarrass Mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way,""  Ajami wrote for The New York Times' Sunday Book Review cover story in 2002. Mackey had an Oklahoma twang, the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of, but that belied her worldly understanding. She would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease. Mackey was a frequent commentator on CNN during the Gulf War in the 1990s. She also appeared on countless other outlets, including Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect,"" to explain in layman's terms what was happening in the region. Her book on Iraq was published one year before the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. The book forewarned of the consequences of such action. ""In a perfect world, Shia, Sunni, and Kurd, followed by a company of other minorities, would walk into the post-Hussein Iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering,"" Mackey wrote. ""But as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware, the world is not perfect."" She said those calling for an invasion of Iraq ""cannot ignore the threats to American security that could come with Hussein's demise."" ""With American troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge, the United States faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant Islam,"" Mackey said. ""... Thus, American military forces rotate in and out, U.S. taxpayer money finances the occupation, and Iraqi hostility to a Western presence increases. There is no exit strategy except retreat."" In 2004 the U.S. military actually flew Mackey to Iraq to teach commanders from the Army's 1st Infantry Division while the war was still raging.

News Article,"Just over a year ago, Adam Johnson sat in a room with journalists at the Stadium of Light and talked about England and the forthcoming World Cup. He wasn’t sharing his opinion as a former international, but as one who genuinely hoped his exile was about to come to a deserved end. Johnson — scorer of seven goals in as many matches for Sunderland —believed he was worthy of a recall, 21 months on from a five-minute cameo in Norway’s Ullevaal Stadium during a Euro 2012 warm-up friendly. Adam Johnson (right) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming . Johnson, an England international, was considered a prospect for Roy Hodgson as recently as a year ago . Johnson (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at Peterlee police station on Thursday . At 26, was it plausible that Johnson had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on Teesside when he quit Middlesbrough — the club who had expertly nurtured him — for Manchester City in a £7million deal four years earlier? For at the Etihad, amid the millionaires and the silverware, Johnson may have become a richer man, but he emerged a poorer player. In February of last year, however, and on the eve of a Capital One Cup final against the club at which his career had stalled, Johnson spoke of playing his ‘best ever football’ and wasn’t joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in Brazil. Few argued. But Roy Hodgson was not aboard the ‘Johnson for England’ bandwagon. Johnson scored seven times in seven games during a run last season, and was still an England prospect . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . The call never materialised and Sunderland — beaten by City at Wembley — finished the season fighting relegation, Johnson scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped. The eulogies which were written in the wake of his joyous January were, on reflection, a little premature. In fact, Johnson’s form has never recovered. Five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him Sunderland’s top scorer, but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances, even if he remains their likeliest match-winner. It is all a far cry from the skinny teenager who dared to dribble and made others dare to dream of the future which lay ahead. Debuting at 17 for Middlesbrough, he was billed as ‘the next Stewart Downing’. In 2005, that was high praise. He made a mockery of full backs and, indeed, those who had likened him to Downing, for it quickly became apparent that Johnson had the potential to be better than his Boro team-mate. Johnson has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) Ched Evans: Charged with rape in July 2011 but played for Sheffield United in September. Not released by club until end of the season. Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer: Not suspended by Leeds after charged with grievous bodily harm and affray in 2000. Jody Morris: Leeds suspended him for two weeks after the player arrested in connection with rape charge, October 2003. After six seasons at the Riverside, he was given the platform to prove as much. But at City, like so many young English talents, he regressed. There were concerns from within the club about his dedication and life away from football. His reputation, though, remained intact, such were the fleeting nature of his sightings in sky blue. To the outside observer, he was done an injustice by Roberto Mancini. And so Johnson was forgiven his uninspiring two-and-a-half years in Manchester when he signed for boyhood club Sunderland for £10million in the summer of 2012. Last year, he reflected on his time at City. ‘There is a temptation (to sign for them), of course. The wages, you’re flattered when City are after you, but you’ll go there and be third choice,’ he said. ‘When I was there, I was always the one who would be dropped when the manager rotated the team. I wouldn’t sign for them now if I was a young English player.’ The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . But perhaps Mancini was sound in his judgment. For although, during three seasons on Wearside, Johnson’s three goals in a trio of victories at North East rivals Newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight, affording him terrace adulation, Sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight-figure sum and wages of £50,000 per week. Now, with Johnson having been charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming, they are facing up to a relegation run-in perhaps without the man in whom they have invested so heavily, should the club decide to suspend him. The future of both Sunderland and their star player hang in the balance.

News Article,"Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson admits he must 'improve as a man' after his fellow professionals appeared to choose him as the most unpopular player on the PGA Tour.

Debate,"In 1924, a new quota system was instituted, based on national origin, that severely limited immigration from southern and eastern Europe. In the debate leading up to this legislation, disability figured prominently. Quota advocates warned that particular nationalities were disproportion ately prone to be mentally defective. Rhetoric about ""the slow-witted Slav,"" the poor physique of Jews, the ""neurotic condition of our Jewish immi grants,"" and the ""degenerate and psychopathic types, which are so con spicuous and numerous among the immigrants,"" was pervasive.27 Restrictionists emphasized the inferior appearance of recent immigrants. One avowed that ""the physiognomy of certain groups unmistakably proclaims inferiority of type."" When he observed immigrants, he saw that ""in every face there was something wrong_There were so many sugar-loaf heads, moon-faces, slit mouths, lantern-jaws, and goose-bill noses that one might imagine a malicious jinn had amused himself by casting human beings in a set of skew-molds discarded by the Creator.""

The Portuguese, the Greeks, and the Syrians are, from our point of view, undersized. The Hebrew immigrants are very poor in physique ... the polar opposite of our pioneer breed.""28 The issues of ethnicity and disability were inextricably intertwined. While disability has been largely overlooked as a category of analysis in the literature on immigration, this is by no means unique to immigration studies. Disability is conspicuously absent from all fields of histories.

News Article,"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man, so he chose the other option, CNN affiliate KVOA reported Wednesday. Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day. His lawyer has said police used excessive force and could have killed a man who was obviously unstable. The Marana Police Department has defended Rapiejko, saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle, ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work. Marana is just northwest of Tucson. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders. ""There were occupied businesses, and there were two officers at the other side of the street,"" he says on the recording. ""This is what I deem as a lethal force encounter. I have two thoughts that go in my mind: I need to shoot him to stop the threat, or I need to run him over to stop the threat."" Another officer, who was slowing trailing Valencia and ahead of Rapiejko, says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon Valencia, the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person. Video of the car striking Valencia sparking nationwide debate on what type of force police should use to go after armed suspects. Many people commended the officer. Some people said the police should have set up a perimeter around the man and talked him into surrendering. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN last week that ""it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.""

News Article,"A father has admitted killing his 13-year-old son by giving him a morphine tablet when the boy complained that he was feeling ill. Kevin Morton gave his son Kye Backhouse an extremely strong painkiller, a court heard - a mistake which he says he will 'have to try and live with it for the rest of my life'. He could now face jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter over the teenager's death at Preston Crown Court. Tragedy: Kevin Morton, right, has admitted killing his son Kye Backhouse, left, by giving him morphine . 'Happy-go-lucky' Kye was found dead at his home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria in October last year. A previous court hearing was told that Morton, 49, gave his son a super-strength morphine tablet because he was feeling unwell. But police and ambulance were later called to the flat, where Kye was found dead and Morton was arrested after admitting he had given his son the painkiller. He confessed to his actions in a Facebook post in December, writing: 'I loved my little boy more than anyone in the world. Death: Kye, 23, complained of feeling unwell before his father gave him the strong painkiller . 'I gave him a tablet by mistake that was too strong for him, it's my fault - I have to try and live with it for the rest of my life but it was an accident.' After Kye's death, his family released a statement paying tribute to the schoolboy. 'The family is devastated at the sudden loss of Kye,' they said. 'He was the most amazing and much-loved young man that anybody could wish to meet - he made everyone around him smile every day and even now with him gone, he is remembered with a smile. 'The emptiness Kye has left in all our lives can only be understood by people who knew and loved him. We are so very proud of him and miss him deeply. 'We cannot even begin to express our feeling of loss - we ache to hold you once more. He was a kind and loving son, brother, grandson, cousin and nephew and a friend to many. 'Kye has left a big hole in the family and things will never be the same again.' During the latest court hearing, Morton hung his head as his barrister James Heyworth said his client made 'full and frank admissions' in police interviews. He was released on bail ahead of sentencing in June, but was warned that he is likely to face jail after pre-sentence reports are prepared for the court. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Morton: 'You have pleaded guilty to a very serious offence. 'As you appreciate, the likely outcome of this case is a custodial sentence. But it's important for the court to have as much information about you as possible in order to assess both the nature of the sentence and the length of it.'","A father has admitted killing his 13-year-old son by giving him a morphine tablet when the boy complained that he was feeling ill.

News Article,"1. Heavy drinking males: Scientists at Sheffield University have identified six different types of obese person (file image) There are six different types of obese person, scientists have today revealed. The distinction, they hope, will allow for tailor-made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight. Researchers at the University of Sheffield analysed people with a body mass index of 30 or more - a recognised measure of obesity. They found obese people fall into one of six categories: . The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are. Dr Mark Green, who led the study, said: 'Policies designed to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles often target individuals just because they are obese. 'But a focus on just the group as a whole is not very efficient. We are all different and different health promotion approaches work for different people.

Scroll down for video . 'In the future, we hope that GPs will keep in mind these six groups when offering advice to their patients.' BMI has long been used to measure individuals in terms of their height and weight, but does not account for variation across other factors such as health, demographic and behavioural characteristics. The team at Sheffield looked at health-related variables, including whether individuals reported conditions like fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or cancer. 2. Young healthy females: The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are.

The affluent and healthy elderly: This group was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption (file image) Demographic variables accounted for were age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation, while well-being was assessed by asking people how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of nought to 10. Whether participants smoked and the number of units of alcohol they consumed in the previous week was also taken into consideration. 4. The physically sick but happy elderly: They had a higher prevalence of chronic health problems including high blood pressure (file image) As was whether or not they engaged in active weight management - going to slimming clubs, for example - and whether they made a conscious effort to eat more healthily. Researchers discovered the largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group. They were the group most likely to display positive health characteristics, and engaged in some healthy behaviours. 'Heavy drinking males' showed similar characteristics, but consumed a high level of alcohol. They were less likely to be managing their weight, though did report above average levels of physical exercise and walking. The 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Their sense of well-being was relatively low, but they did engage in healthy physical activity and weight management, and had the lowest alcohol consumption. The final three clusters captured different patterns among older people. The 'affluent healthy elderly' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption. The 'physically sick but happy elderly' group had a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions -including osteoarthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure - but exhibited low levels of anxiety and depression. 5.

For example, for the 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' an intervention involving increasing exercise may need to be mixed with psycho-social counselling, while for those in the 'poorest health', group advice on exercise may not be reasonable and more modest goals may be needed.

 Sent 11: Researchers said health professionals should assess what group obese patients might fall into and treat them accordingly. 
 Feedback 11: Keep this in the summary. This sentence summarizes the practical implication of the study's findings for health professionals.","Remove these from the summary:
 
 ""The distinction, they hope, will allow for tailor-made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight.""
 Reason: While this sentence introduces the study's goal, it focuses more on the researchers' aspirations rather than the core findings.
 
 ""Dr Mark Green, who led the study, said: 'Policies designed to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles often target individuals just because they are obese... In the future, we hope that GPs will keep in mind these six groups when offering advice to their patients.'""
 Reason: These quotes from Dr. Mark Green highlight the researchers' intentions and suggestions but don't directly contribute to summarizing the study's findings and implications.
 
 ""BMI has long been used to measure individuals in terms of their height and weight, but does not account for variation across other factors such as health, demographic and behavioural characteristics.""
 Reason: While this highlights the limitations of BMI, it's more of a general background detail rather than a key finding.
 
 ""2. Young healthy females:""
 Reason: This is a section heading that doesn't provide relevant information for the summary.
 
 ""Demographic variables accounted for were age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation, while well-being was assessed by asking people how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of nought to 10.""
 Reason: This sentence delves into the methodology of the study rather than the core findings.
 
 ""Whether participants smoked and the number of units of alcohol they consumed in the previous week was also taken into consideration.""
 Reason: This detail is specific to the study's methodology and doesn't directly contribute to summarizing the findings.
 
 ""4. As was whether or not they engaged in active weight management - going to slimming clubs, for example - and whether they made a conscious effort to eat more healthily.""
 Reason: Similar to the previous point, this delves into the study's methodology rather than the key results.
 
 ""Researchers discovered the largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group.""
 Reason: This is a specific finding about one cluster but doesn't contribute to summarizing the overall results.
 
 ""'Heavy drinking males' showed similar characteristics, but consumed a high level of alcohol.""
 Reason: This sentence introduces another cluster but doesn't provide crucial information for the summary.
 
 ""The 'affluent healthy elderly' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption.""
 Reason: Like the previous point, this introduces a cluster but doesn't contribute to summarizing the core findings.
 
 ""The 'physically sick but happy elderly' group had a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions -including osteoarthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure - but exhibited low levels of anxiety and depression.""
 Reason: This introduces another cluster's characteristics but doesn't directly contribute to summarizing the main outcomes.
 
 ""5. The unhappy and anxious middle-aged: This group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue.""
 Reason: Similar to previous headings, this doesn't provide essential information for the summary.
 
 ""6. Those with the poorest health: This group was found to be the most deprived, and had the highest prevalence of chronic health conditions. And they tended not to engage in healthy behaviours.""
 Reason: This is another section heading that doesn't directly contribute to summarizing the main outcomes.
 
 ""It also had the highest average BMI.""
 Reason: While this fact is interesting, it's not a crucial detail for the summary.
 
 ""For example, for the 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' an intervention involving increasing exercise may need to be mixed with psycho-social counselling, while for those in the 'poorest health', group advice on exercise may not be reasonable and more modest goals may be needed.""
 Reason: This details specific interventions and recommendations but doesn't contribute directly to summarizing the core findings.
 
 ""Meanwhile messages about alcohol reduction could help tackle obesity in young adults.""
 Reason: This suggests a potential intervention but doesn't provide essential information for summarizing the study.
 
 ""The findings are published in the Journal of Public Health.""
 Reason: This is a standard conclusion note that doesn't provide significant information for the summary."
Debate,"Space power as a theory illustrates the importance of strategic space systems and demonstrates that space is the “ultimate high ground” in which policy makers and commanders will need to formulate actions to seize and control in support of strategic objectives. Theoretically, on-orbit offensive space capabilities would be used to find, fix, track, and destroy targets in space, air, on land and at sea. Again, if this capability existed, the employment of space weapons would be more of a combat multiplier in support of the other geographical mediums rather than providing unilateral control of all environments from space. Gray contends that space power “adds the greatest value for lethality in combat in the twentieth century.” 22 However, since most of the United States’ current offensive space power capabilities are ground-based and augmented with superior conventional as well as other non-kinetic weapons and forces, one could argue that we currently control the space medium without the cost, proliferation and hazards associated with placing weapon systems in orbit. Gray believes that the strategic interest in terms of space power theory “lies in the consequences of its application for deterrence and the conduct of war as a whole.” 2 The concept of space control put forth by Gray compares the control of the space medium as similar to conducting blockades and ‘choke points’ like Mahan’s maritime strategy for sea power. Space has similar choke points such as specific launch sites attempting to launch offensive space weapons or satellites that are susceptible to attack or that can be held at risk. 24 Again, these choke points or space blockades can be affected using existing capabilities without the need for placing weapons in space. The naval theories of Sir Julian Corbett are probably more fitting when considering a space power theory based on the control of space. Corbett emphasized the “conditional nature” of sea control. He believed that the conditional nature could be positive and defined as one’s ability to travel the seas freely. Corbett also believed that the conditional nature could be negative or the ability to deny this freedom to the enemy. It could either be local or global, permanent or temporary. This theory is very similar and applicable to the strategy of space control. 25","Space power as a theory illustrates the importance of strategic space systems and demonstrates that space is the “ultimate high ground” in which policy makers and commanders will need to formulate actions to seize and control in support of strategic objectives.

Debate,"With all of the benefits and risks associated with nanotechnology most people don't seem too concerned about it. A recent study conducted by the National Science Foundation discovered that more than 67 percent of the people who responded to a survey expressed positive views of nanotechnology and said it would be likely to improve their lives, particularly in the medical arena. About 37 percent said the main risks were unexpected consequences and harmful side effects. Another 13 percent said it was weaponization and 9 percent thought medical and environmental contamination were the main risks. At 5 percent or less people felt privacy, expense and product failure concerns were risk factors. When it came to regulation about 50 percent said government regulation is necessary to address safety concerns. The researchers recruited and surveyed a panel of 76 adults over the course of 32 months. These individuals included community opinion leaders, environmental stakeholders, members of various church groups and other citizens. In addition to completing multiple surveys over time, the panelists also took part in structured interviews with open-ended questions on nanotechnology.","With all of the benefits and risks associated with nanotechnology most people don't seem too concerned about it.

News Article,"Police in Florida are investigating a possible road rage incident after a woman filmed a man throwing a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while driving his van. Michelle, a 32-year-old mother who has asked for her surname not to be used, said the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle. She said she followed the man and taped him after he swerved in and out of traffic while speeding on a stretch of road that has two school crossings. Scroll down for video . Cell phone footage recorded by a mom in Jacksonville, Florida, on Tuesday shows a 28-year-old man, Dan Frank, throw a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while he was driving his van . When she pulled up next to the man, he threw the bottle at her car, she told Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Further down the road, she said, the driver got out of his van in traffic and made rude hand gestures at her. Michelle said she followed him to his nearby home, where he ran inside before coming outside again to confront her. 'I didn't know if he stashed something or was returning with a weapon,' Michelle told ActionNewsJax. She left at that point and met with police at another location. Police have identified the driver as Daniel Robert Frank, 28, who was arrested earlier this month for an unrelated offence. Frank is helping police who are investigating the case as misdemeanor criminal mischief and his attorney says there is more to the case than simply the video footage. A woman named Michelle, right, told police that the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle . 'We feel that Mr. Frank was the victim here and things spiraled out of control,' Lewis Fusco told ActionNewsJax. Fusco said his client went through a yellow light, and that the trailer he was hauling could have crossed the line when the light turned red. 'She then threw some kind of a large object at his front window that put a crack in my client's window,' said Fusco. 'At that point, that's when he became angry and did something that he is not proud of and retaliated as shown in the video.' Frank refused to an on-camera interview, but showed local reporters a dent on the hood and small cracks in the windshield of his vehicle. According to his attorney, Frank had a passenger in the van with him during this attack who has made a written statement corroborating his claims.","Police in Florida are investigating a possible road rage incident after a woman filmed a man throwing a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while driving his van.

News Article,"FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has admitted that he is still considering whether to join Premier League leaders Chelsea this summer. Earlier this month club president Naoki Ogane claimed that the Blues have made an offer - believed to be around £4million - for the  Japan international. Chelsea would look to loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season but the 22-year-old is keen to join a club where he will play regularly and realise his potential. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has a shot against Shonan Bellmare during a J-League clash . Chelsea have made an offer for Muto according to FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane . Asked about a potential switch to London this summer after scoring the winner against Shonan Bellmare last week, Muto said: 'I want to think about it carefully. 'Where can I go to develop? A team that suits me, where I can play and develop. I'm thinking about that, and for now I just want to take my time and think it through.' Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic gave Muto his debut for FC Tokyo in July 2013 and he believes the pacey forward could be a big hit at Stamford Bridge. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Popovic said: 'His potential was amazing, I didn't see for a long time such an intelligent player like Muto. He's a different guy, he's not such a usual player. 'Muto is something like a noble. He has something different to all other players because he comes from a good family, he has good education, he was at university. A very smart, intelligent guy. He has something which you cannot learn. 'He was so fast. So speedy and, for a Japanese guy, so strong. And also so confident. He has a lot of confidence. In our training games Muto always had chances. Amazing. He had 10 or 12 chances in every game.' Muto says he is still considering a move to Chelsea as he wants to join a club where he will 'play and develop' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had admitted that he is aware of the Japan international . Chelsea signed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber in February and Jose Mourinho has admitted that commercial interests do play a part in the club's transfer policy. Asked about Muto earlier this month, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.'","FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has admitted that he is still considering whether to join Premier League leaders Chelsea this summer.

Meeting,"Speaker 1: The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Report to the full council. Please read item number one.
Speaker 2: The report at the full council agenda item number one Council 118 549 relating to cable television, authorizing the mayor or the mayor's designee to enter into a renewed cable television franchise agreement with Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC, and authorizing the Chief Technology Officer to enter into other agreements for the purpose of implementing or administering the renewed franchise
Speaker 2: held December seven, 2015.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.
Speaker 3: Thank you very much. So by way of background, you may recall we held this legislation to have some more discussion. This is basically an ordinance which renews the ten year franchise agreement for Comcast. And I want to go into a little bit of detail about what we're able to get from Comcast for this franchise.
Speaker 3: And it's important to note that this is not an exclusive franchise. We have other franchises in the city with Wave and CenturyLink as well. I do want to say right at the beginning that I thank all of you for being here on even other issues.
Speaker 3: It's unfortunate that we don't have enough time for everyone to speak, but your presence here, we are honored by your presence and for you fighting for what you believe in. So do you apologize? We didn't have the opportunity to to hear from all of you.
Speaker 3: Anyway, let's get back to Comcast. So basically and again, I don't report that everyone sort of understands this. There are certain things the city can regulate and certain things they cannot. For example, the city cannot control Comcast prices.
Speaker 3: And that's something that always is people are concerned about. The city cannot control Internet service that's regulated by the federal government. And so in our franchise agreement, we're looking at one part of what they provide, which is the the cable piece in this particular agreement, what we were able to basically get in terms of our goal and
Speaker 3: you may recall that our goal is to improve competition, have strong customer service and consumer protections. So everything we do must be designed to protect the consumer. So we updated the cable code establishing new standards for all cable providers back in March.
Speaker 3: There you have discussions about our cable, our customer bill of Rights and response times and what a customer's rights are. If they're not being treated fairly by Comcast or others. In this particular agreement, we're able to make sure that Seattle joined Comcast's pilot program that they have for low income seniors.
Speaker 3: You're eligible for the Internet Essentials discounted Internet program. And so we're able to get that very recently because we observed and I should say we it's the executive of the Department of Information Technology and the City Council observed that similar traction was was occurred had occurred in Philadelphia.
Speaker 3: We're able to get that here. We're able to get the previously announced digital equity grant offer to Seattle from a one time $50000 to $100000 per year for five years. That's about $500,000 in additional benefits. We will partner with Comcast at the City of Seattle to help risk risk add youth, obtain devices such as laptop computers.
Speaker 3: We have $8 million in public educational and governmental access channel financial support for those those public services. We have a 30% discount on basic tier, low income subscribers, and we have 600 modems to nonprofit organizations that's valued at about $10 million.
Speaker 3: In short, we had our Department of Information Technology go toe to toe with Comcast to get as many community benefits and consumer protections as we could. I will sort of close by saying we've had lengthy discussions about Comcast role and obligation.
Speaker 3: Our community and the city takes those very, very seriously. We hear daily people complaining about Comcast wanting competition, wanting lower rates. And so we have done everything possible in the last several months trying to achieve that. Last, I will say that many of the benefits that we've gotten, because they were not directly cable related, came in this
Speaker 3: letter agreement that I think all of you now have either talked to legal counsel or have seen the letter. And so we do have opinions that this is about as binding as it can get, given the sort of the hand that we're dealt, the hand being some of these are non cable related through theories of the legal
Speaker 3: theories such as promissory estoppel or equal to stop and all these fancy terms that sort of describe what Comcast must do. We are comfortable that that letter, that December 7th letter's binding. So the committee recommends passage of this legislation.

Debate,"Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and cyber crime are in the headlines as significant threats to our national security. However, over the next twenty to thirty years, America’s overwhelming dependence on oil presents subtler, although no less serious, threats to national security. The U.S. is the largest consumer of oil in the world, burning through 18.83 million barrels per day. Even if the U.S. produced all petroleum products domestically, Americans would still feel the shocks from market volatility. Oil is a global market, and market prices prevail regardless of origin. Despite policies to improve vehicle efficiency, America remains dependent on oil. This dependency presents several threats to U.S. national security. First, oil price volatility hampers American productivity and consumers. Economic vitality requires stable prices, as spikes in oil prices may reduce output and wages while increasing inflation and interest rates. Most commonly, consumers feel these disruptions at the gas pump. The transportation sector alone consumes 13.223 million barrels of petroleum per day. Petroleum facilitates the functioning of these critical transportation networks, and small disruptions may lead to cascading price dumps. As volatile oil prices destabilize the economy, they jeopardize U.S. interests and national security. Secondly, U.S. oil dependency distorts foreign policy. The U.S. imported 40% of its petroleum products in 2012. In order to ensure foreign oil security, the U.S. supports regimes it might not otherwise. Many oil-rich Islamist regimes in the Middle East receive de facto support from America in return for producing stable oil, despite conflicting ideologies and interests. Similarly, estimates show that extended military operations to guard oil supply lines cost the U.S. military $67.5-$83 billion per year. This dependency is costly and conflicts with the national security agenda. Lastly, oil dependency undermines military preparedness and effectiveness. The Department of Defense consumed 117 million barrels of oil in 2011 in order to fuel the military’s vehicles, ships, and planes. The military must complete its missions, and without fuel options, it must endure oil price fluctuations. For every 25-cent increase per barrel of oil, the Department of Defense pays an additional $1 billion in fuel costs per year. Additional fuel costs means the military has to cut costs elsewhere, which have negative impacts on security and military preparedness. Military energy security requires reduced consumption of petroleum products, yet the Department of Defense depends on oil for 80% of its energy needs. The military may reduce consumption by reforming energy-intensive activities, optimizing energy usage, and developing innovative technologies to reduce energy waste, but sequestration budget cuts will slash future investment. Instead of focusing solely on drilling for more oil, the U.S. must pursue a two-pronged approach that focuses on reducing oil demand while at the same time makes investments in developing alternative fuels. Clean energy technologies could cut imports by 44% which is nearly eight times more than potential domestic drilling production. Greater efforts to improve vehicle efficiency through corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE), congestion charges, or fuel taxes can contribute to reducing oil consumption. Moreover, America’s oil dependence saps the U.S. economy because consumers lack fuel options. To that end, investments in alternative sources of fuel – biofuels, natural gas, electric vehicles – can act as a hedge against oil price volatility. Throughout 2012, the U.S. spent $4.36 billion on energy research, which fell well below IEA recommendations. Due to budget caps and sequestration, energy research funding will drop substantially over the next few years. Oil dependency is a long-term threat. The rising cost of oil dependence affects all aspects of American society and threatens national security. If the U.S. wishes to reduce these threats in the future, the U.S. must properly fund energy research and development to commercialize technologies that will break America’s oil dependency. Only then can we say we have actually achieved energy security.","Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and cyber crime are in the headlines as significant threats to our national security.

Debate,"As mentioned above, there is another order of criticism or discrepancy toward the term Islamophobia, which though fully linked to ethnic, religious and cultural aspects, is in itself used as individual criticism over the use of this terminology. Such is firstly the case of ‘etymological/ terminological criticism.’ From this viewpoint, the terms ‘anti-Muslim racism,’ ‘anti- Arab’ or even ‘intolerance against Muslims’ 18 are clearer than the term Islamophobia for various reasons. On the one hand, use of the word ‘phobia’ in the concept is not considered appropriate, as it would imply the existence of a sort of mental illness (phobia: obsessive aversion to someone or something and/or compulsive irrational fear); on the other, the term Islamophobia is not considered ‘ideal,’ for there is no specific rejection of Islam as a religion, but rather a rejection of Muslim individuals or collectives or those defined as such. This kind of criticism even makes an analogy between the word Islamophobia and the word ‘anti-Semitism,’ arguing that from a grammatical standpoint anti-Semitism should signify a prejudice against Semitic peoples in general, even though it is exclusively used to refer to hostility against the Jews. In this regard, the grammatically incorrect Islamophobia would require the 150 years which the term ‘anti-Semitism’ needed to become grammatically acceptable, except that Jews recognize themselves and are recognized as being a single ethnic group, contrary to the case of Muslims.","Such is firstly the case of ‘etymological/ terminological criticism.’ From this viewpoint, the terms ‘anti-Muslim racism,’ ‘anti- Arab’ or even ‘intolerance against Muslims’ 18 are clearer than the term Islamophobia for various reasons.

News Article,"Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate has warned West Ham must be ready to face a 'wounded animal' at Manchester City on Sunday, but will be ready to inflict more pain on Manuel Pellegrini's men. The Barclays Premier League champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches, thrashed 4-2 at rivals United last weekend - a result which left the long-term future of manager Pellegrini in doubt as City might now face a scrap with Liverpool for a Champions League qualifying spot. West Ham are also in need a pick-me-up, having seen victory slip through their fingers when Stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at Upton Park. West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate is wary of facing champions Manchester City on Sunday . City midfielder Yaya Toure (centre) and his team-mates suffered a 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford last week . Senegal midfielder Kouyate expects City to produce a response, but also one from Sam Allardyce's squad, who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the European places. 'Anything is possible in football, but we mustn't forget who we are up against. They are a wounded animal, because they need points, so they have to wake themselves up to win,' Kouyate said on the club's official website, www.whufc.com.

'It is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year's champions of England.

Marouane Fellaini (right) scores United's second goal as City fell to another Premier League defeat . Kouyate added: 'A team like Manchester City can't afford to make mistakes, so for us it's a good time to face them, but we mustn't underestimate them, there's life in them yet.' West Ham look short of options in attack. Striker Enner Valencia is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against Stoke, while Diafra Sakho, who has netted 12 goals in all competitions, is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain. Allardyce is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses. He said: 'That leaves us very short on the front line with Andy (Carroll) being out, and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be, so if we don't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us.'","Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate has warned West Ham must be ready to face a 'wounded animal' at Manchester City on Sunday, but will be ready to inflict more pain on Manuel Pellegrini's men.

'We have become more consistent, more adept at dealing with the different problems that we face and how teams set up against us, so we are in a good place at home. 'Hopefully the crowd can inspire us because we are going to need them more than ever.

Debate,"On the other hand, some have called for a moment of pause, suggesting that we should be wary of overly concrete or introspective analyses of the local, as such accounts inadequately attend to the principal attributes and meaningful bonds of neoliberalism as a global project(Brenner & Theodore, 2002; Peck & Tickell, 2002). The ‘larger conversation’ that neoliberalism provokes is regarded as imperative in connecting similar patterns of experiences across space, which may serve as a potential basis for building solidarities (see Brand & Wissen, 2005;Escobar, 2001; Featherstone, 2005; Kohl, 2006; Routledge, 2003; Springer, 2008, 2011b;Willis, Smith, & Stenning, 2008). Thus neoliberalism as a concept allows poverty and inequality experienced across multiple sites to ﬁnd a point of similitude, whereas disarticulation under-mines efforts to build and sustain shared aims of resistance beyond the micro-politics of the local. Accordingly, conceptualizing neoliberalism requires an appreciation of the elaborate and ﬂuctuating interchange between the local and extra local forces at work within the global political economy (Brenner & Theodore, 2002; Ferguson & Gupta, 2002; Peck, 2001). Ong (2007,p. 3) corroborates this notion by conceptualizing ‘big N Neoliberalism’ as ‘a ﬁxed set of attributes with predetermined outcomes’, while ‘small n neoliberalism’ operates in practice ‘as a logic of governing that mitigates and is selectively taken up in diverse political contexts’. In this light, Peck and Tickell (2002, p. 383) propose ‘a processual conception of neoliberalization as both an “out there” and “in here” phenomenon whose effects are necessarily variegated and uneven, but the incidence and diffusion of which may present clues to a pervasive “metalogic”.Like globalization, neoliberalization should be understood as a process, not an end-state’. Thus, neoliberalism-cum-neoliberalization can be viewed as a plural set of ideas emanating from both everywhere and nowhere within diffused loci of power (Plehwe & Walpen, 2006). The inability to straightforwardly align neoliberalism to particular individuals, organizations, or states, and the further recognition that there is no ‘pure’ or ‘paradigmatic’ version of neoliberalism, but rather a series of geopolitically distinct and institutionally effected hybrids (Peck, 2004),plays a signiﬁcant role in the difﬁculty of realizing consensus on a conceptual deﬁnition of ‘neo-liberalism in general’.

Debate,"An Arizona-based algae technology company says it’s on to something big: harnessing the growth of algae at a commercial scale so that it can ultimately be used as a transportation fuel. “Heliae” broke ground Friday on its new plant. Now, all it needs is an abundance of sunshine, water and carbon dioxide.¶ But while the ingredients to make algae may be simple, it is still an open question as to whether current pilot facilities can attract private investors that will enable the industry to gear up. Beyond the financial concerns, environmental worries persist. It can involve taking carbon emissions from power plants to grow the algae before converting it to something that would run cars, trucks and airplanes.¶ In a phone interview, Heliae’s Chief Executive Dan Simon explained to this writer that the company’s ultimate goal is to produce transportation fuels. To get to that point, though, it will focus on near-term aims that are more attainable: chemicals, cosmetics and healthy foods. As it develops, the enterprise will then expand overseas and into the Asia Pacific region.¶ “We will never take our eyes off the transportation fuels,” says Simon. “But there are stepping stones to get us there. Production costs have to come down. Right now, the economics don’t work. It will be 5 to 10 years before all of this will affect the price at the pump.”¶ Simon continues, saying that “good science takes time” and that by first picking the “low hanging fruit” the company will drive revenues and efficiencies, and bring down production costs. Among the key goals the company is working towards: Ensuring that the process has a “positive energy impact,” meaning that it can’t take more energy to grow the algae than the amount of carbon dioxide that the algae would absorb.¶ Critics maintain that the recycling of carbon lends credence to the burning of fossil fuels and in the end, more carbon is emitted than is captured. The journal of Environmental Science and Technology, furthermore, looked two years ago at the life cycle of algae compared to other bio-fuels such as corn and switch-grass. It concluded that using conventional crops to create fuels will result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less water consumption than if algae is used to do the same thing.¶ The study also says that most of the carbon that is getting captured is coming from places other than power plants and oil refineries. That’s because there is not yet an effective way to bottle such releases from industrial sources.¶ Those findings, however, have been refuted by the Algae Biomass Association, which says that researchers have used outdated data that is tied to older production methods to draw their conclusions. To that end, the industry, which has kept its production processes proprietary, is now saying that it may be willing to share its newest information so that such students can better understand today’s technologies.¶ “If it cost you more energy to make it, then what is the point,” says Nick Donowitz, director of corporate development for Heliae. “Based on the work we’ve done, we are charging on a path toward an energy neutral or energy positive system.”¶ Algae, today, is a blip on the radar.

Debate,"On July 21, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 13806 on Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States. The EO directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a whole-of-government effort to assess risk, identify impacts, and propose recommendations in support of a healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base – a critical aspect of economic and national security. The EO 13806 effort was initiated by the White House Office of Trade & Manufacturing Policy led by the Department of Defense’s Office of Industrial Policy in coordination with the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Energy, and Homeland Security, and in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade & Manufacturing Policy. America’s manufacturing and defense industrial base (“the industrial base”) supports economic prosperity and global competitiveness, and arms the military with capabilities to defend the nation. Currently, the industrial base faces an unprecedented set of challenges: sequestration and uncertainty of government spending; the decline of critical markets and suppliers; unintended consequences of U.S. Government acquisition behavior; aggressive industrial policies of competitor nations; and the loss of vital skills in the domestic workforce. Combined, these challenges – or macro forces – erode the capabilities of the manufacturing and defense industrial base and threaten the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to be ready for the “fight tonight,” and to retool for great power competition. The following report explains the macro forces impacting the industrial base, identifies primary categories of risk, illustrates impacts within sectors, and provides recommendations for mitigation.","On July 21, 2017, President Donald J.

Combined, these challenges – or macro forces – erode the capabilities of the manufacturing and defense industrial base and threaten the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to be ready for the “fight tonight,” and to retool for great power competition. The following report explains the macro forces impacting the industrial base, identifies primary categories of risk, illustrates impacts within sectors, and provides recommendations for mitigation. ","On July 21, 2017, President Donald J.

The EO directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a whole-of-government effort to assess risk, identify impacts, and propose recommendations in support of a healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base – a critical aspect of economic and national security.

News Article,"The Red Wings' Drew Miller says he's eager to hit the ice again just a day after receiving a cut that could have cost him his eyesight. 'I feel very blessed the skate didn't hit my eye,' Miller said at practice on Wednesday. 'Very lucky' Skating with a full face mask during practice, the Detroit forward openly bore a gruesome red wound that required 50 to 60 stitches to close along multiple layers of skin, the Detroit Free Press reports. Gruesome: Miller was left with a scar across his eye, but reportedly didn't suffer any damage to his eyesight after another player cut him across his face . The incident occurred shortly after a faceoff during the first period of Tuesday's game between the Red Wings and the Senators. While battling for the puck, Ottawa's Mark Stone lost his balance and lifted his right skate backwards in an arc, catching Miller just under his visor. Stone's skate cut Miller along his right cheek and again just below his eyebrow. Miller exited the ice under his own power before medical staff rushed him to receive treatment, including stitches. Though he has a gash that runs across both sides of his eyelid and bruising below his right eye, Miller said his vision was largely unaffected. 'Right now, it's just dealing with the cut and the stitches and the soreness,' Miller explained. 'Other than that, my eye is good, and when I got on the ice today, I felt pretty good.' Freak accident: While falling to the ice, Ottawa's Mark Stone lifted his skate and struck Miller under the visor with the blade . Stitched up: Twitter user Red Wing Memes published a photo of the Red Wings forward with the freshly stitched wound . Second opinion: A second angle showed Stone losing his balance while fighting for the puck with the Red Wings' Luke Glendening . Bruiser: Miller said he wanted to come back for the third period after being stitched up, though the team said he will likely return Thursday against Boston . My Fox Detroit reports Miller had wanted to return during the third period of the game, which Detroit lost 2-1. Red Wings Coach Mike Babcock said Miller will likely have a 'big-time scar' but to expect the winger to be on the ice Thursday. The team will need Miller, who has played in 159 straight games, as it tries to secure the final guaranteed playoff spot in the Atlantic division.","The Red Wings' Drew Miller says he's eager to hit the ice again just a day after receiving a cut that could have cost him his eyesight.

Debate,"It has been widely acknowledged that the federal government has lost control of our national finances. Deficits are approaching $1 trillion every year, about 70 percent of the budget is on autopilot, total public debt now exceeds $22 trillion, and total public debt to gross domestic product has almost doubled from 54 percent at the end of calendar 2000 to around 105 percent at the end of calendar 2018, and it continues to rise further. The truth is that the current budget system is badly broken and needs major reforms. In addition, the Constitution does not provide adequate protections designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and intergenerational equity. Since the beginning of the new millennium, several political and economic figures have stated that we should not be concerned. Recall that former Vice President Cheney said that “deficits do not matter.” In fairness, he may have been speaking politically rather than economically, but it was an irresponsible comment. He also said that the United States would make money on the second war with Iraq. How did that turn out? More recently, some prominent economists, including Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman, have espoused a “modern monetary theory.” This theory essentially states that deficits do not matter and assumes the nation can borrow at reasonable interest rates without limit due to our dominant reserve currency status. It assumes that the United States is exempt from the law of prudent finances, and that public and private interests will always have confidence in the United States irrespective of its policies. That is not a prudent or logical assumption. It is also contrary to history. The federal government has been using budget control mechanisms have failed to ensure fiscal prudence and sustainability for the future. As a result, the time has come to make the following budget reforms to promote fiscal sanity, sustainable growth, and intergenerational equity. First, the federal government should move to biennial budgets. After all, Congress has passed timely annual budgets and appropriation bills four times over the past 67 years. That performance de”serves a grade of F. The federal government should adopt separate operational and capital budgets like a vast majority of the states have. The current unified federal budget approach has served to constrain needed infrastructure and other investments that benefit multiple generations while also failing to control mandatory spending. There should be automatic continuing resolutions based on prior year recurring spending if the Congress does not pass an appropriations bill by the start of the fiscal year. Shutdowns are extremely disruptive and are certainly not in the interest of American taxpayers. The federal government should adopt a “no budget no pay” policy like California. Under this policy, members of Congress would not get paid if all appropriations bills were not passed by the beginning of the fiscal year. The pay for lawmakers would be resumed once all appropriations bills are passed, but there would be no retroactive pay. Members of Congress are responsible for passing annual appropriations bills, and they need to be held accountable and suffer the consequences if they fail to do their jobs. The debt ceiling should be repealed and replaced with a statutory debt to gross domestic product limit. The current debt ceiling has failed, and the United States is the only major nation that has such a limit. In addition, most industrialized nations focus on debt to gross domestic product as the most appropriate measure of fiscal sustainability. Such a measure would encourage economic growth policies that are fiscally sustainable. Given the seriousness of our fiscal challenge and the failure of statutory budget control approaches in the past, Congress should pass a federal fiscal responsibility amendment to the Constitution that, among other things, limits debt to gross domestic product to no more than a stated percentage absent a formal declaration of war or a supermajority vote by the Congress. This provision would have to be acted on each fiscal year that the limit would otherwise apply. Violation of this provision should result in no member of Congress being able to campaign for reelection. If the Congress fails to pass a fiscal responsibility amendment, the states should exercise their power under Article V of the Constitution and do so through a single issue convention. At the moment, there are 28 states of the required 34 states that have already passed the required resolution. The above reforms should help to restore fiscal sanity to our nation over time. They would also help us discharge our stewardship responsibility to our children, our grandchildren, and all future generations of Americans.","It has been widely acknowledged that the federal government has lost control of our national finances.

 Feedback 13: Keep this in the summary. This sentence summarizes the anticipated positive outcomes of the proposed reforms.","Remove these from the summary:
 
 ""In addition, the Constitution does not provide adequate protections designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and intergenerational equity."" 
 Reason: This sentence introduces a topic that is not elaborated on further in the document. It is not directly tied to the proposed reforms and doesn't contribute to the main argument.
 
 ""Since the beginning of the new millennium, several political and economic figures have stated that we should not be concerned. Recall that former Vice President Cheney said that 'deficits do not matter.' In fairness, he may have been speaking politically rather than economically, but it was an irresponsible comment. He also said that the United States would make money on the second war with Iraq. How did that turn out?
 Reason: This passage contains historical references and commentary on the statements of specific individuals, which is not central to the document's focus on budget reforms.
 
 ""More recently, some prominent economists, including Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman, have espoused a 'modern monetary theory.' This theory essentially states that deficits do not matter and assumes the nation can borrow at reasonable interest rates without limit due to our dominant reserve currency status. It assumes that the United States is exempt from the law of prudent finances, and that public and private interests will always have confidence in the United States irrespective of its policies. That is not a prudent or logical assumption. It is also contrary to history."" 
 Reason: This passage introduces a separate economic theory and critiques it, but the theory itself is not the main focus of the document, which is about budget reforms.
 
 ""After all, Congress has passed timely annual budgets and appropriation bills four times over the past 67 years. That performance de”serves a grade of F."" 
 Reason: This sentence introduces historical context that doesn't significantly contribute to the main argument regarding budget reforms.
 
 ""The current unified federal budget approach has served to constrain needed infrastructure and other investments that benefit multiple generations while also failing to control mandatory spending."" 
 Reason: This sentence introduces a critique of the current budget approach but doesn't provide additional insights relevant to the proposed reforms.
 
 ""There should be automatic continuing resolutions based on prior year recurring spending if the Congress does not pass an appropriations bill by the start of the fiscal year. Shutdowns are extremely disruptive and are certainly not in the interest of American taxpayers."" 
 Reason: While these points are relevant, they introduce a specific solution to budget issues that isn't the main focus of the document.
 
 ""The pay for lawmakers would be resumed once all appropriations bills are passed, but there would be no retroactive pay. Members of Congress are responsible for passing annual appropriations bills, and they need to be held accountable and suffer the consequences if they fail to do their jobs."" 
 Reason: This sentence suggests a specific policy for holding lawmakers accountable, which isn't the core theme of the proposed reforms.
 
 ""The current debt ceiling has failed, and the United States is the only major nation that has such a limit. In addition, most industrialized nations focus on debt to gross domestic product as the most appropriate measure of fiscal sustainability. Such a measure would encourage economic growth policies that are fiscally sustainable.""
 Reason: While these points are relevant to the broader fiscal context, they introduce an analysis of the current debt ceiling system rather than focusing on the proposed budget reforms.
 
 ""This provision would have to be acted on each fiscal year that the limit would otherwise apply."" 
 Reason: This sentence refers to a specific provision without directly advancing the core arguments for the proposed reforms."

Debate,"It is essential, however, that the search for such alternatives take for a point of departure the contemporary world situation, which is no longer to be grasped in terms of past conceptualizations. While it is necessary to view contemporary ide­ologies of globalization critically, we can ill afford to overlook that they address contemporary challenges that are quite real. Especially important in this regard is the conceptualization of the world in terms of the Three Worlds idea. In past days, the Three Worlds idea provided a significant means to grasp global economic and political configurations. As late as the 1970s, the idea of the Third World pointed to certain concrete forms of economic exploitation and political struggle. By the 1 980s, the struggle part of the meaning had lost its salience, rendering the Third World synonymous with backward or undeveloped, which also suggested a return to the original post—World-War-Il use of the term. The Third World, which ear­lier had been a location of possible alternatives to both First World capitalist and Second World statist modernities, came increasingly to denote those areas in the world that were falling behind in the race of progress. At the same time, economic developments associated with globalization further scrambled the tenuous bound­aries between the Three Worlds. The fall for all practices of statist socialist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 was the final event to render irrelevant earlier concep­tualizations of global configurations. With global capitalism has emerged a situation that not only signals an end to the Three Worlds idea, but even more radically to the dichotomization of the world around East/West or North/South distinctions. What are gone are not only concepts for organizing the world, but also concepts that served to give coherence to projects of emancipation. The irrelevance of the concepts, however, does not imply the disappearance of fundamental aspects of the situation that the concepts encompassed, especially the divisions between rich and poor, and the conditions of inequality, oppression, and exploitation, which are perhaps sharper today than in the past.1’ The problem with contemporary alternatives to the Three Worlds idea—globalization, postmod­ernism, and postcolonialism—is not that they do not articulate a new situation, but that they turn their backs on the persistent material and cultural problems created by the globalization of capitalism. Such Third World issues—which are no longer confined to a geographical Third World—are literally absent from discussions of modernity and postmodernity; as such discussions appear as “an all-Western debate; an Occidental quiz, with Western answers to Western questions.”’2 The problems these discussions present are not abstractly intellectual but pro­foundly pedagogical, with implications for everyday social ideologies. Students— especially those who are nourished by Western academic culture—are often caught in a situation where postmodem and postcolonial theories substitute for knowledge about other countries, knowledge of languages, and most certainly knowledge of other theories. To a degree this book is addressed to these students. The authors must assume that “it is not possible for anyone to stand outside either their mater­ial reality (both human and nonhuman) or of the evolving context of ideas.” ide­ally, “one must operate taking cognizance of how the available alternatives will affect human beings living in the particular world of the present.”’3 Postmodernism and postcolonialism encourage preoccupation with identity and subjectivity, but only by displacing into the realm of culture the kind of self-knowledge that comes with the confrontation of historically circumscribed material realities. The end result is, on the one hand, not so much self-knowledge as the denial of the possi­bility of knowledge of any kind and the re-reification of identities that produces a liberal relativism, and on the other hand, murderous separation of human beings. To overcome this new mode of culturalism in both its liberal and conservative man­ifestations, it is necessary once again to confront life in all its materiality, which unites as well as divides humans across the globe. To this end, the various chapters in this book reaffirm the historicity of the present to spell out the material context that produces contemporary cultures and ideologies, including the contemporary crisis of history. Similarly, the alternative historiographies the chapters propose insist on the persistence of past problems while recognizing the changed circumstances of the present; hence the title, History after the Three Worlds, which parts with the Three Worlds idea but reaffirms it as the historical condition of the present.","It is essential, however, that the search for such alternatives take for a point of departure the contemporary world situation, which is no longer to be grasped in terms of past conceptualizations.

Speaker 3: 2193 A letter dated February 14th, 2020 from Michael V Hancock Mayor notifying City Council of his veto of Council Bill 20 zero zero 71. Council President Clark and Members of City Council. Over the past several days, I have heard from thousands of residents passionately expressing their opinions on both sides of this issue.
Speaker 3: I want to thank everybody who has shared their views, especially those I have spoken to personally experts in veterinary care, animal care and control, as well as residents of our city who have had experiences with the pit bull breeds, all to gain a broader understanding of what this change would mean for our community and those who own
Speaker 3: these dogs. After deep reflection and consideration, I find that I cannot in good conscience support this legislation and will exercise my authority as mayor to veto it. Let me say at the outset that I salute the sponsor of this ordinance, Councilman Herndon, and his fellow council members who have tried to craft legislation that creates a data and
Speaker 3: licensing system for these breeds that is supported by veterinary experts and encourages owners of pit bull breeds to manage their pets. Unfortunately, less than 20% of all pets in Denver are currently licensed, which raises significant questions about the effectiveness of this proposed new system.
Speaker 3: While much progress has been made in recent years to increase that number, more intentional efforts around responsible pet ownership, dog licensure and registration and off leash dogs are needed before this proposal should be considered. The reality is that irresponsible pet owners continue to be a problem and it is the irresponsible owners and their dogs I must consider
Speaker 3: in evaluating and the overall impact of this ordinance. We cannot diminish the very real, very traumatic experiences of those who have reached out to me to share their stories. Well, I appreciate the effort that Councilman Herndon has put into crafting this ordinance and its guardrails.
Speaker 3: I do not believe this ordinance fully addresses the very real risk to severe injury that can result from attacks from these particular dog breeds, especially should they happen to a child. At the end of the day. I must ask whether passage of this ordinance would make our homes and neighborhoods safer or pose an increased risk risk to
Speaker 3: public safety. I have concluded that it will pose an increased risk. Increased risk. I encourage members of City Council to reconsider their approach to this ordinance, which has been in the municipal code for over three decades.

Dialogue,"#Person1#: I have with me this evening, Louise Graham, a group leader at Ravens Field Outdoor Adventure Center for children. Louise, how long have you been there?
#Person2#: Well, before I first went there 2 years ago, I thought I'd probably only stay for a year. But after 6 months or so. I really started to enjoy the job, so I'd been there ever since. To be honest, I was lacking in self confidence and when I first arrived I was a bit worried about making mistakes. I was frightened I might put the children in danger because of my inexperience.
#Person1#: What's the best thing about your work?
#Person2#: One thing I like is seeing them have so much fun. Even if sometimes their behavior isn't perfect, and I can suggest activities that haven't been tried before, but there are always some children who haven't quite got as much ability as others, and for me, the most rewarding part of the job is getting them to succeed and things they haven't managed to do before. It's hard work though, sometimes you're on duty at night.
#Person1#: Um, what do you think about that?
#Person2#: Well, I can't say I look forward to starting work at 10:00 PM. But the kids have to be looked after 24 hours, so someone has to do it, and all the staff take turns.","#Person1#: I have with me this evening, Louise Graham, a group leader at Ravens Field Outdoor Adventure Center for children. #Person2#: Well, before I first went there 2 years ago, I thought I'd probably only stay for a year.

Debate,"But since 1988, when education policy shifted away from desegregation efforts, the reading test score gap has grown — to 26 points in 2012 — with segregated schooling increasing in every region of the country. Research has shown that integration is a critical factor in narrowing the achievement gap. In a 2010 research review, Harvard University’s Susan Eaton noted that racial segregation in schools has such a severe impact on the test score-gap that it outweighs the positive effects of a higher family income for minority students. Further, a 2010 study of students’ improvements in math found that the level of integration was the only school characteristic (vs. safety and community commitment to math) that significantly affected students’ learning growth.","But since 1988, when education policy shifted away from desegregation efforts, the reading test score gap has grown — to 26 points in 2012 — with segregated schooling increasing in every region of the country.

News Article,"Kevin Pietersen has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans. The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? #comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '#comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy.

He would, therefore, seem an unlikely viewer of Pietersen's Periscope net session.","Kevin Pietersen has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans. The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? #comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '#comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy.

News Article,"Bruce Jenner has confirmed he started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. The 65-year-old told Diane Sawyer he embarked on hormone therapy and electrolysis, and had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine, shortly after winning the Olympic gold. However, he says, he stopped out of 'fear' of publicity and shame, and kept his secret to himself until he couldn't bear it any longer. Scroll down for video . Early signs?  Bruce Jenner has revealed he started having hormone therapy and plastic surgery in the mid to late 1980s to make himself look more feminine. He's shown here in September 1987 . Before the changes: Bruce, seen here on set, still had his athletic physique and heavy set masculine features when he appeared in the 1980 film Can't Stop The Music. These were noticeably gone by the end of the decade . Bruce said he was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. On Friday night, he publicly addressed about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. As the romance between Bruce and Kris blossomed in late 1990 and early 1991, the former star athlete  halted hormone therapy and underwent breast reduction surgery. The couple married months after meeting on April 21, 1991, and went on to have two children together - Kendall, now 19, and Kylie, 17, - before divorcing in December last year. Change of heart: Bruce halted his gender transition after meeting Kris Kardashian in late 1990. He stopped hormone injections and even underwent breast reduction surgery before the couple married.  He's seen here with Kris in February 1993 . Family man:  Bruce and Kris tied the knot in April 1991 just months after meeting. Seen here in 2000 with their daughters Kendall and Kylie, the couple were married for 22 years. Bruce found fame again with a whole new generation thanks to the reality series about their blended family Keeping Up With The Kardashians . A source quoted by Entertainment Tonight says that Bruce was greatly influenced by the life story of transgender tennis player Renee Richards. Richards, born a boy Richard Raskind in 1934, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1975. In 1976, she launched a legal challenge after the US Tennis Association denied her permission to compete as a woman in the U.S. Open because she had not been born a woman and in 1977 the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in a landmark decision for transsexual rights. It's believed that her autobiography Second Serve, published in 1983, had a significant influence on Bruce. In 1986, the book was made into a TV movie starring Vanessa Redgrave who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Inspiration: Transgender tennis player Renee Richards won the right to complete as a woman in the 1977 U.S. Open after winning a landmark legal battle. Richards was born a boy in 1934 . Textbook transition: It's suggested that Bruce was greatly influenced by Richards' life story as outlined in her 1983 autobiography Second Serve. The Kardashian-Jenner patriarch and reality TV star addressed his gender journey during the two-hour prime time special airing tonight on ABC. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' In a message of support, TV's Dr. Phil told ET on Thursday that he's happy for the Olympian. 'This is his body and his life, and he needs to do what he wants to do,' said Dr. Phil. 'It drains your spirit if you can't be yourself. He is freeing himself.' The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address his gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' Looking to the future: The clip released Thursday concluded with Bruce asking, 'how does my story end?' Tight lid: ABC has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from Bruce, paving the way for his story to air in full tonight . Moral support: The 65-year-old father-of-six appears alongside his four oldest children  Burt, 36, Casey, 34, Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo . Not appearing in the interview: Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Kourtney Kardashian, 36, as well as Kendall, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, are not scheduled to talk during the interview .","Bruce Jenner has confirmed he started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife.

Debate,"But a new study by RTI International suggests that STEM isn’t for everyone. While nearly a quarter of high performing students who began pursuing a bachelor's degree between 2003 and 2009 declared a STEM major, nearly a third of these students had transferred out of STEM fields by spring 2009.¶ Right off, the study raises a lot of questions.¶ ""In light of the nation's need to build a strong STEM workforce to compete in the global economy, it is important to understand why college students are leaving STEM majors,"" said Xianglei Chen, research education analyst at RTI. ""Our results indicate that students' intensity of STEM coursework in the first year and their performance in STEM courses may have played an important role in their decision to switch majors.""¶ The study looked at the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study and tracked freshman bachelor's degree students over 6 years, focusing on STEM attrition among a group of high-performing college students.¶ By “high-performing,” the authors mean hard-working college students who demonstrate consistent, high-level performance during their 6-year college enrollment – prime candidates for STEM-related career fields.¶ The research team also used grade information to look at the STEM courses taken and how students performed in those courses, searching for any link with students leaving STEM majors.¶ Dropping out¶ What they found first was that low-performing students in STEM fields left the curriculum because they dropped out of college. It raises the question, without providing the answer, whether these students might have continued their education had they been in a less-challenging field of study.¶ Second, the study found that the high-performing students who quit STEM did so largely by switching to another major.","But a new study by RTI International suggests that STEM isn’t for everyone.

Debate,"However, it is important to mention that the Chinese impact on the economic and trade relations of nafta, considering the region as a whole, have been exaggerated. In reality, it can be argued that the impact of China has been limited. From figure 5, we can see that China is an important partner of the three countries, with shares of 14%, 7.6% and 9.2% in the United States, Canada and Mexico markets, respectively. On the other hand, the members of nafta still represent the largest share of trade with each other. In the case of the United States, its two nafta partners had a combined share of 29% of the market; for Canada, 65.9% and for Mexico 69.2%. When comparing the Chinese export shares in each of the three countries that make up nafta, it is clear that they are still much lower than the export shares within the region.","However, it is important to mention that the Chinese impact on the economic and trade relations of nafta, considering the region as a whole, have been exaggerated.

News Article,"You might know that H20 is the chemical formula for water, but what about the chemistry of you? Dr Joe Hanson, a science writer and biologist based in Austin, Texas, pondered this very question and now has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements. He revealed that a 'human molecule' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen, 132 million atoms of oxygen and 85 million atoms of carbon. By comparison, this human molecule contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum. When written out in full, the human molecule would read: Co1 Mo3 Se4 Cr7 F13 Mn13 I14 Cu76 Zn2,110 Fe2,680 Si38,600 Mg40,000 Cl127,000 K177,000 Na183,000 S206,000 P1,020,000 Ca1,500,000 N6,430,000 C85,700,000 O132,000,000 H375,000,000. The full list of elements that Dr Hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each 'molecule' Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth. Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Over our lifetimes the proportions of these elements change as age and we pick up traces of other elements like heavy metals and gold. Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98 naturally occurring elements, just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on Earth. 'In ancient times scholars believed everything in the universe was made from just four elements - earth, water, fire and air. 'Today we know it is a little more complicated than that. Living things are made up of cells, cells are made up of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms. 'But that old idea turns out to be sort of right. 'Altogether, 97% of the mass all living matter is made of just four chemical elements.' Dr Hanson, who created the video for the It's Okay to be Smart PBS channel on YouTube, also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg (35lbs) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants. He said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine. But the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort. If the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails, they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a US cent (one sixteenth of a penny), according to Dr Hanson. He said: 'The average adult contains detectable amounts of 60 elements, mostly just traces of our diet and environment that have built up over time. If you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form, the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market. 'Of course you can't really do that, but it gives us another way to look at life.' Biologist Dr Joe Hanson has worked out what the human body would look like as a chemical formula (above) The average adult human body contains around 16kg (35lbs) of carbon.

Sent. 5: The full list of elements that Dr Hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each 'molecule' Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth.
Feedback 5: This sentence is important for coherence because it elaborates on human molecule composition.
Sent. 6: Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98 naturally occurring elements, just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on Earth.
Feedback 6: This sentence is important for coherence because it goes further to explain the number of elements essential to some form of life on Earth.
Sent. 7:  'Altogether, 97% of the mass all living matter is made of just four chemical elements.
Feedback 7: This sentence is important for coherence because it highlights that only four elements make up a super majority of the mass of all living matter.
Sent. 8: He said: 'The average adult contains detectable amounts of 60 elements, mostly just traces of our diet and environment that have built up over time.
Feedback 8: This sentence is important for coherence because it further stresses on the detectable amounts of elemnts in an adult.
Sent. 9: The average adult human body contains around 16kg (35lbs) of carbon.
Feedback 9: This sentence is important for coherence because it goes further to highlight the approximate amount of carbon in the human body.","Remove all the sentences between ''Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents... and ''Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98...'' from the model summary since they give a historical theory of how life on earth may have been formed. This has little informational value to the human molecule composition.
Remove the following sentences from the model summary: ''In ancient times scholars believed everything in the universe was made from just four elements - earth, water, fire and air. 'Today we know it is a little more complicated than that. Living things are made up of cells, cells are made up of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms. 'But that old idea turns out to be sort of right.'' as they provide little additional information.
Remove the following sentences from the model summary: ''Dr Hanson, who created the video for the It's Okay to be Smart PBS channel on YouTube, also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg (35lbs) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants. He said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine. But the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort. If the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails, they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a US cent (one sixteenth of a penny), according to Dr Hanson.'' as they provide little additional information.
Remove the following sentences from the model summary: ''If you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form, the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market. 'Of course you can't really do that, but it gives us another way to look at life.'

News Article,"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure.

Speaker 2: Our state aid has been dropping, but but year over year, our state assessments for charter school tuition and the MTA climb exponentially. The result is in our budget, year after year is increased reliance on property taxes for a revenue source.

If the state is going to pursue targeted scrutiny and oversight of the city of Boston, we should we should assess what is and isn't working from the current relationship for the interests of the city.
Looking ahead, I believe we need a more proactive collaboration with this with the Boston delegation members, including those in leadership roles such as the leaders from my district and those chairing committees like Ways and Means at the State House.
We also are looking at the possibility of a governor from the city sitting in the corner office in less than a year from now.

Debate,"There is no clear demand for large UUVs in the private sector in the near term. Small UUVs are more marketable because they provide for current needs and are easier to handle. It is, currently, not clear what commercial advantage a large UUV would offer that would offset the larger business cost. Using a dual commercial-government scenario the current availability of large displacement UUVs that could be used as is or be modified for use by the Navy is limited. Developing and proving the application of large UUVs in both military and commercial applications is necessary to create a market for these vehicles. Before a large UUV procurement can be pursued, the Navy must prove that it is worth the extra footprint and infrastructure required on the combatant ships of the future. Commercial manufacturers must prove that the additional burden required to operate a large displacement UUV is offset by its added functionality and capability. There is a large amount of anecdotal information suggesting that large UUVs with extended mission capabilities, endurance and autonomy can be a viable and cost effective systems in both the military and commercial marketplaces. However, hard data does not exist to convince commercial manufacturers, the Navy, commercial customers and academic research institutes to invest without engaging in some type of enterprise that shares the cost and risk burden.

Debate,"Sinn (2008, 2012) coined the term green paradox to describe the idea that a climate policy that becomes more ambitious during the decades ahead is an announced expropriation for the owners of fossil fuel resources, thus inducing them to accelerate resource extraction and global warming. It works as follows. A gradual tightening of climate policy over the coming decades exerts a stronger downward pressure on future prices than on current ones, thereby curbing the expected rate of capital appreciation of fossil fuel reserves. The owners of these fossil fuel deposits try to avert this scenario by increasing extraction rates and converting the sales revenue into investments in the capital markets, which offer higher yields. Hence, a climate policy that becomes more aggressive over time acts as an announced expropriation that provokes owners to react by accelerating the rate of extraction of their fossil fuel stocks and thereby exacerbating global warming. Sinn (2008) deserves credit for intensifying efforts to better understand the channels by which one can fight global warming. Furthermore, the problem is even more severe in an international context in which carbon leakage and the green paradox may reinforce each other.12 Countries that do not join in efforts to curb fossil fuel demand thus benefit in two ways: by burning the lower-priced carbon set free by the carbon-reducing countries and by burning the additional carbon extracted as a result of the announced and expected price cuts following the gradual increase in the carbon tax.","Sinn (2008, 2012) coined the term green paradox to describe the idea that a climate policy that becomes more ambitious during the decades ahead is an announced expropriation for the owners of fossil fuel resources, thus inducing them to accelerate resource extraction and global warming.

News Article,"Samantha Crossland escaped a custodial sentence after the £22,000 she admitted stealing from her employer and friend had been repaid in full . The daughter of a millionaire lottery winning couple who stole over £22,000 from a children’s nursery has escaped jail - after the cash was paid back. Samantha Crossland, 30, was pocketing parents’ fees being paid to the Child’s Play day nursery she worked at in a trusted position. She had been told she faced a custodial sentence unless the money was paid back and Crossland - whose parents made over a million on the lotto - handed back the cash. Nursery owner Lynda Quigley confirmed that the amount stolen - £22,642 - had been paid into her bank account on from an “S. Crossland”. It was not clear whether this was Samantha - or her mother Susan Crossland. Crossland had even been promoted to manager at the nursery by its owner who knew her and trusted her. Much of the money was taken from a cash box on the wall that parents left their fees in. Leeds Crown Court court heard that only Crossland and Mrs Quigley had keys to this. It was only when Mrs Quigley returned to the nursery in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in early 2014, that she became aware of discrepancies in the accounts. In total these came to £22,642. Crossland was arrested and gave four no comment interviews. She later pleaded guilty to one count of theft. The court heard today that Mrs Quigley had received £22,643 via bank transfer on April 22. Crossland, of Mirfield, West Yorkshire was sentenced  to a 12-month community order and 180 hours unpaid work. Recorder Ray Singh said: 'You were in a position of significant trust by Miss Quigley. You were left alone to deal with the money, it is therefore a breach of trust. 'Staff parents and the like were no doubt finding it very difficult to understand what was happening.” Mrs Quigley, who has had the nursery for 14-years, said after the hearing: 'I feel really relieved that I’m finally going to get closure now that the court case has finished and the money taken has been repaid in full. 'I’m happy that justice has been served after what has been a very difficult year. 'But I still have no idea why she did this to me - why a good friend would betray me like this.' Crossland's parents Michael and Susan won more than £1.2 million on the lottery back in July 2008 . The money was stolen by Crossland, pictured,  from the Child's Play nursery in west Yorkshire . Crossland refused to comment on her sentence while leaving court. Crossland’s parents, Susan and Michael, hit the headlines after winning £1.2 million on the lottery in 2008. At the time of their win, mum-of-four Susan said she believed her £1,218,618 windfall was down to her late father Barrie - as she played his numbers each week in the two years since he had died. Speaking in July 2008, she said: She said: 'My win must be fate which is why I saw the feathers and won on his number line. 'During the week before the draw, I was seeing white feathers everywhere and I never know where they come from. 'Just two-days before the win, we were tickling my dog Ruby at home and a white feather just floated down from nowhere and landed on her tummy. I knew it was dad trying to say something. 'I feel he is looking out for me and he would have been so pleased for us. It’s a real shame he isn’t here to share the winnings with us after he helped us to get it.'","Samantha Crossland escaped a custodial sentence after the £22,000 she admitted stealing from her employer and friend had been repaid in full .

Debate,"It's more than a little upsetting that in more than three hours of testimony before Congress on her nomination to be the new U.S. secretary of education, neither Betsy DeVos nor the members of Congress grilling her said anything—not a single word—about a cohort of more than a half-million American students who will fall under the Department of Education's remit. That group? Native American students. The challenges facing Native students in America today are known, although hardly ever discussed outside of Native communities. According to national statistics, our students are more likely to be labeled as having special needs and experience higher rates of suspension and expulsion than white students. Just 67 percent of Native students graduate from high school—a figure well below the national average. —Getty This is in part due to a tribal education system that has been imposed on us by the federal government for 150 years. But contrary to what many think, education in Indian Country is not in need of a solution imposed by others who know little about our communities. Solutions already lie within. Created in the 19th century, the federal system responsible for educating American Indian students and funding Indian schools is a direct result of treaties entered into by our sovereign tribal nations and the federal government. At its inception, this education system had a stated policy of forcing the assimilation of Indian people by eradicating tribal culture. Students were intentionally taken away from their families and placed in boarding schools, where many endured physical and mental abuse. Slowly, the federal government moved away from these devastating policies, but the system that remains today for Native students is underfunded and inadequately staffed. The buildings our students study in are plagued with infrastructure problems, yet federal money, which should be guaranteed in accordance with long-standing treaties, has not been made available to fix them. The story of the Havasupai Elementary School in Arizona, at the heart of a recently filed lawsuit, is an example of how our federal education system has failed Native students. Nine students from the school are suing the Bureau of Indian Education for ""knowingly failing to provide basic general education."" These are problems seen not just in this school, but in many other BIE schools across Indian Country. The failure to fully fund school construction, renovations, and repairs, coupled with the current federal hiring freeze (which could prevent teacher vacancies from being filled), does not set our students up for success. ""The system that remains today for Native students is underfunded and inadequately staffed."" Still, many outside of Indian Country have offered several ""answers"" to repair the failing, broken system our children and their families endure. There have been calls to privatize schools through vouchers, to move responsibility from the federal government to state control, or to close some BIE schools entirely. Every one of these so-called solutions, while well-meaning, has a common thread: Tribes and Native people were not involved in the development of any of them. This means, unfortunately for us all, they are unlikely to work. Simply put, lasting solutions must be developed in partnership with Native communities, and there are examples across Indian Country that show how tribal innovation and leadership can lead to programs and services that meet communitywide needs. Through local control and direct community engagement, tribes have redesigned their courts, health-care systems, and workforce. For example, in Alaska, innovative approaches to dental health have made significant headway in improving youths' oral health at a fraction of the standard cost. In Montana, the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai have transformed workforce-development programs and cut their unemployment rate by 20 percentage points. In Washington state, the Tulalip Tribe has developed a world-class, culturally sensitive tribal court system that has reduced recidivism rates among tribal offenders. Programs like these show that a win-win situation is possible when federal funds are spent in accordance with what the community wants and needs. And, today, we have a new opportunity to ensure these same successes in education. The education system promised by the trust responsibility to our tribes must be honored, not dismantled with vouchers or a hand-off of control to a state or local government body. The solutions lie within our communities. Everyone—tribes, the federal government, and other partners—must work together to ensure that the schools where our children are educated have the flexibility to create innovative approaches to meet the unique educational and cultural needs of Indian students. This can only be done through a tribal-led system. The work needed to transform the lasting hallmarks of a failed federal system cannot be done overnight or in isolation. Before more money is thrown into another well-meaning but poorly crafted solution, our existing schools should be given every opportunity to thrive, regardless of who leads the Department of Education. Native students absolutely need new culturally based approaches to providing the world-class education they deserve. To get there, we need committed partners who understand that traditional knowledge and culture-based education are key to producing engaged, successful learners. And we need partners who understand that tribes and Native communities must not only have a voice, they must lead the way.","It's more than a little upsetting that in more than three hours of testimony before Congress on her nomination to be the new U.S. secretary of education, neither Betsy DeVos nor the members of Congress grilling her said anything—not a single word—about a cohort of more than a half-million American students who will fall under the Department of Education's remit.

Debate,"Two key Senate Republicans on executive branch oversight are expressing worry that federal agencies -- including possibly OSHA and other branches of the Labor Department -- have repeatedly leveraged guidance documents to create effectively binding policies without going through rulemaking channels. They are asking Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and some other department heads for data on any complaints lodged with agencies that guidance documents are being used to enforce policies on which the public had no input. One industry attorney says OSHA is clearly involved, as the agency uses guidance on issues such as ergonomics, heat illness and crowd control as ""cannon fodder"" for general-duty cases against industry -- though it will be hard for Republicans to prove OSHA used such guidance alone to bolster citations. Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN) and Sen. James Lankford (OK) note that a recent Supreme Court decision affecting administrative law, Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, clarified that guidance is meant to ""advise the public"" and ""do[es] not have the force and effect of law."" That decision held that substantial changes to interpretive rules (as opposed to legislative rules) are not required to go through notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). ""We are concerned, however, that federal agencies are increasingly using guidance that appears to create new requirements without the benefit of notice and comment but with the expectation that the public comply,"" the senators told Perez May 7. They cited recent testimony before the health committee, which Alexander chairs, by an Education Department official saying the agency expected that colleges and universities comply with its guidance. ""Yet, guidance is not intended to be binding."" Lankford chairs the subcommittee on regulatory affairs and federal management. The GOP letter does not name OSHA but makes clear that all of the DOL agencies are subject to the lawmakers' information requests -- including a list of all guidance issued on or after July 24, 2007 that have been the subject of a complaint that DOL is not following procedures outlined in the Office of Management and Budget's Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices. OMB issued the bulletin to establish procedures for the use of significant guidance documents and, the letter points out, cautioned that ""rules which do not merely interpret existing law or announce tentative policy positions but which establish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with the APA's notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they are initially labeled."" The bulletin also requires an agency to set up an office to receive complaints from the public that the agency is not following procedures in the OMB policy or is improperly treating a significant guidance document as a binding requirement. The bulletin considers guidance ""significant"" when it has a ""broad and substantial impact on regulated parties."" The Mortgage Bankers case was in some respects a win for agencies, in that the court ruled that the APA's notice and comment requirements did not apply to substantial changes to interpretive rules, overturning a longstanding doctrine known as Paralyzed Veterans that evolved from case law in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Republicans note that the Mortgage Bankers ruling recognized the potential for overreach in interpretive rules, with the Supreme Court saying ""there may be times when an agency's decision to issue an interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is driven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment provisions [of the APA].""","Two key Senate Republicans on executive branch oversight are expressing worry that federal agencies -- including possibly OSHA and other branches of the Labor Department -- have repeatedly leveraged guidance documents to create effectively binding policies without going through rulemaking channels.

News Article,"(CNN)Pope Francis will visit Cuba on his way to the United States in September, the Vatican said Wednesday -- a trip that will come months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The exact timing of the Cuba trip wasn't immediately released, but the Vatican said the Pope would stop in Cuba before his planned late September stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. In Havana's Cathedral Square, people reacted joyously to the news. ""The Pope coming here, maybe he could ... make more positive ways for Cubans to go towards religion, more than politics,"" said Raul Garcia, a Cuban-American who returned to the island. ""I think it's going to be a very good visit, very beneficial for the country."" ""We are waiting for him. We're very happy he is coming,"" said Ulises, a man who sells brightly colored paintings of antique cars to tourists on the street next to the sprawling Havana Cathedral. ""He should come and get to know it and walk around the pretty spots in Havana."" Cuba's state-run television reported that Francis would visit, but like the Vatican did not report exactly when he would arrive. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The Pope made personal pleas to Obama and Cuban leaders in private letters, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries. ""I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,"" Obama said in December as he announced a U.S. policy shift on Cuba. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs. He repeatedly urged Western leaders not to bomb Syria, hosted a prayer service between Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the Vatican and waded into diplomatic controversy last week by referring to the killing of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago as a ""genocide."" The latter move deeply upset Turkish leaders, who recalled their Vatican ambassador. The Pope is expected to continue his international activism in July with a trip to South America, where he will visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. In late September, Francis will visit Washington, where he will address Congress; New York, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly; and Philadelphia, where he will celebrate a public Mass that's expected to draw more than 1 million people. Francis will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. Church officials in Havana said that they expect Francis' visit to be shorter than those of his predecessors. Officials from the Vatican are expected to travel to the island soon to finalize logistics for Francis' trip, the officials said . CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.

Feedback 1: This sentence sets up the context for the entire article, introducing Pope Francis' planned visit to Cuba and his involvement in the thawing of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US, therefore, its inclusion in the coherent summary is justified.
Sent.2: ""The exact timing of the Cuba trip wasn't immediately released, but the Vatican said the Pope would stop in Cuba before his planned late September stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia.""
Feedback 2: This sentence expands on the details of the visit and situates it within Pope Francis's larger US tour.
Sent.3: ""Francis, the first pope from Latin America, played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro.""
Feedback 3: This sentence is vital as it elaborates on Pope Francis's role in the improved Cuba-US relationship, which is a central topic of the article.
Sent.4: ""The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries.""
Feedback 4: This sentence provides more context about the Pope's role in the thawing relations between the two countries, detailing specific outcomes of his involvement.
Sent.5: ""Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs.""
Feedback 5: This sentence provides relevant background information about Pope Francis, highlighting his interest in global politics, which underscores the significance of his diplomatic efforts.
Sent.6: ""Francis will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012.""
Feedback 6: This sentence offers historical context about papal visits to Cuba, indicating a continuity of engagement with the country from the Vatican, which further emphasizes the relevance of Pope Francis's upcoming visit.","The model summary is thorough and includes almost all the information contained in the document. To make it more similar to the coherent summary, it could remove some of the direct quotes from Cuban citizens and U.S. President Barack Obama as they do not contribute directly to the overall understanding of the Pope's visit and his role in U.S.-Cuba relations. Instead, it could include the sentence about Pope Francis being the third consecutive Pope to visit Cuba, which adds valuable context."
News Article,"(CNN)Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com.

Debate,"The Latino electorate played a decisive role in key U.S. Senate races in 2020 and will again be crucial in determining outcomes in the 2022 midterm elections, according to a report published today by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute. The report analyzes the choices of Latinos in 2020 Senate elections in five states where Latino voters were pivotal either because of their large numbers or the part they played in close races: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico and Texas. And with an eye toward 2022’s most contested races, the authors spotlight the frequency with which Latinos selected one party’s candidate for president and another’s for the Senate. In all these states, the authors found, Latino voters supported Democratic Senate candidates by wide margins in 2020. In Arizona, Colorado and Georgia, they voted for Democratic Senate candidates over Republican candidates by a 3-to-1 margin, and in New Mexico and Texas by a 2-to-1 margin. Yet despite this overwhelming support for Democratic Senate candidates, a considerable number of Latino voters — between 2% and 10%, depending on the state — split their ballots between parties when choosing Senate and presidential candidates in 2020. These swing voters will likely be a critical segment in this year’s midterm elections, particularly in states like Arizona and Georgia where Senate races are currently considered toss-ups, the authors said. Importantly, determining the future balance of power in the currently divided Senate and elsewhere will depend heavily on Latino voter turnout efforts, especially continued investments by all political parties in direct voter engagement and mobilizations by political campaigns, said the institute’s founding director, Sonja Diaz. “Voting patterns show the critical role Latinos play in pivotal midterm elections, but these votes must be earned,” Diaz said. “Campaigns for House and Senate seats should ensure they are reaching the Latino electorate by addressing the needs of this community and utilizing tailored outreach techniques proven to result in voter mobilization.”","The Latino electorate played a decisive role in key U.S. Senate races in 2020 and will again be crucial in determining outcomes in the 2022 midterm elections, according to a report published today by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

Debate,"Ted Cruz made no mistake in highlighting his opposition to a set of educational standards known as Common Core in his first presidential campaign speech. ""Instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through Common Core,"" he said to applause from the Liberty University crowd on March 23, ""imagine repealing every word of Common Core."" Formally known as the Common Core State Standards, the once low-key, bipartisan effort to improve math and literacy education has quickly transformed into a major issue for many conservatives like Cruz, now a Republican U.S. senator from Texas, as they believe it's just another example of government overreach. It's also a way for Cruz and other politicians likely to vie for the Republican Party nomination—including Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker—to differentiate themselves from potential front-runner Jeb Bush. The former Florida governor is a long-time Common Core supporter, a topic detractors could seek to tie to his establishment credentials and political moderation. That combination of factors has virtually assured that Common Core will be an important topic of debate ahead of voting in November 2016. ""It will be a major issue because of its symbolic importance,"" said Tom Loveless, who researches education policy as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a politically centrist think tank. ""It's red meat for the kinds of conservative activists that a number of the contenders on the Republican side want to appeal to."" From bipartisan to blow up Until a few years ago, Common Core seemed like a benign push to make sure American public school students were competitive in English and math. Shaped by Democratic and Republican governors and education leaders, the benchmarks were adopted voluntarily in 45 states and the District of Columbia. But Common Core has fast become controversial. Conservatives pundits like Glenn Beck and Michelle Malkin helped spread the notion of a Washington takeover of schools after some federal funding was linked to Common Core. On the left, teachers unions that once backed Common Core expressed concerns on its recent rollout, worried that it added to overtesting of students and unfair evaluations of instructors. Primary action Attention to Common Core will be most visible during the presidential primaries, according to experts. The key to that is Bush, a longtime supporter of improving educational standards in his time as Florida governor from 1999 to 2007. As conservative opposition to Common Core has grown, Bush has been forced to defend his stance. ""Raising expectations and having accurate assessments of where kids are is essential for success, and I'm not going to back down on that,"" Bush said during a congressional fundraiser in Iowa in March, according to The Associated Press. That position has put him at odds with most other likely opponents. Take Jindal, the Louisiana governor, for example. After initially supporting the standards, Jindal sued the Obama administration in August over Common Core, claiming that the federal grants to states related to the Race to the Top program were unconstitutional because they forced states to adopt the standards. (Program grants were for general standards improvement, although much of the money distributed was related to Common Core.) Like Jindal, several other big names initially supported Common Core—or gave it tacit approval—but have now turned against the standards or backed away from them. Examples include Wisconsin Gov. Walker, New Jersey Gov. Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Besides Cruz, other likely candidates who are against Common Core include Kentucky Sen. Paul, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""They're all sort of moving away from it,"" said Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at libertarian think tank Cato Institute. ""I don't think you want to be called a flip-flopper, but even worse is to be associated with a policy that people really don't like.""","Ted Cruz made no mistake in highlighting his opposition to a set of educational standards known as Common Core in his first presidential campaign speech.

News Article,"An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: ""Has she got a baby in her belly?""' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs . As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer . 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

Debate,"To summarize, we have demonstrated that there is a military and civilian gap, at least when we compare higher-ranking elite military officers and civilian elites. On some measures, elite military officers appear far more similar to the mass public in their pattern of confidence in major American institutions than do the presumed leaders of those institutions, the civilian elites, This should alert us to subtleties underlying confidence in the military. In the rest of this chapter, we provide some exploratory examinations of how the notions of ""confidence"" may be profitably unpacked. The analysis thus far suggests that confidence in the military may not be as solid and stable as the commonly reported Gallup results imply. People who have little or no contact with the military express lower levels of confidence in the military. The effect is sharpest at the elite level, where an absence of contact with the military can have a large impact on expressed confidence, Nevertheless, majorities even among the least pro-military groups express confidence in the military. Thus, to a certain extent, the conventional wisdom is correct: American civil-military relations are blessed by the remarkable degree of confidence the military enjoys from the mass and elite public. But does this confidence extend beyond a mere appreciation that the military is capable of doing what it is askedto do? Is there an underlying sense of alienation between the groups, acknowledged or latent? Is there a consensus on how civil-military relations affects military effectiveness or on the day-to-day workings of civilian control? To answer these questions, we analyze civilian and military opinion across a broader range of topics.","To summarize, we have demonstrated that there is a military and civilian gap, at least when we compare higher-ranking elite military officers and civilian elites.

Speaker 1: Thank you. Council president. This is a talking about the Broadway protected bike lane. I just. I know this is in my district. This is not in my district. I want to thank Councilmember Clark for for allowing me to call this out when I guess I have the purview to call it.
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I did want to to talk in favor of of this contract. I as as people know, I believe we all deserve the freedom to get from A to B safely, no matter how we choose to get there.
Speaker 1: And I'm excited that this early protected bike lane will soon receive permanent treatment. I know that Denver and Dottie specifically are working hard to install bike lanes quickly, and they're using a paint and post method that allows us to do that rapid implementation.
Speaker 1: It also allows us to test bike lane implementations before significant infrastructure infrastructure investment is wasted. In other words, we're making sure we get the curves and angles right. But the best protected bike lane has more permanent infrastructure in place, so it's creates stronger barriers between bikes and cars.
Speaker 1: It's better looking infrastructure that fits in with the look and feel of concrete curbs, concrete medians, etc., and fits better in our neighborhoods as well. It helps. It also helps cyclists feel safe that cars won't sneak into the bike lane, which they haven't, which happens all the time, or delivery vehicles or city vehicles or people dropping off
Speaker 1: passengers. Happens all the time. So finally, I recognize that the best infrastructure goes from people from where people are to where they want to go. So I think it's important that the Broadway protected bike lane continue north from the border of Lucky District seven into District ten.
Speaker 1: What might be called a perfect implementation is if it were to continue all the way through District ten northern border. Thank you. Council President.
