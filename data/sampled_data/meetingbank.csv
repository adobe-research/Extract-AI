"Speaker 1: Councilman Austin.
Speaker 0: Pushing case.
Speaker 2: Thank you, adam. 14, please.
Speaker 0: Item 14 is a report from Public Works Recommendation to authorize City Manager to execute a public walkways occupancy permit for sidewalk dining at Sterling Diner Restaurant located at 411 fourth is third street district three.
Speaker 2: Thank you again to Councilman Price.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I recommend my colleagues support this item. This is. I know normally we don't have patio dining permits on. We don't take them out of consent. But this is one where the community was very involved and it's at the request of the community that we've pulled the item.
Speaker 1: So I imagine they would like to come and speak to it. I'm not sure. But I will say that we've worked very closely with the community on coming up with the particular design for this patio dining area. I believe the architect is also here.
Speaker 1: The business, the community and our public works department have worked very closely to address the concerns in this for this particular location, because it's located within close proximity to a lot of homes. Have also talked with the business owner who has been very receptive in terms of making some operational improvements that will continue to enhance the relationships
Speaker 1: between the business and the community with this expansion into the patio dining area. So with that, I'd recommend approval by my council colleagues.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Is there any public comment here?
Speaker 1: Yes. Very quickly. My name is Maureen Neely. I'm the president of the Belmont Heights Community Association. And I'd just like to state that we really appreciate the opportunity that the councilwoman prices allowed us to have a public opportunity to speak.
Speaker 1: Fortunately, I think we've covered all of the the bumps and areas that could have been controversial. And we're at the point where we've got a design we can live with. And like the councilwoman said, she's also committed to working with the operator to make sure all of the other smaller bumps about having an operation and right inside
Speaker 1: a neighborhood next door to residences is as painless as possible. So thanks again and appreciate the opportunity to speak. I don't see the architect here, but the design looks pretty good, so. Oh, hey, Nathan. Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Fantastic. And I love to see the see some images at some point. Sounds like a great project. Members, please cast your vote.

"Speaker 0: Alan Teague.
Speaker 5: Mayor. City Council members. I'm Alan Teague. You're probably going to see me a lot tonight. I've read through the agreement and I also read through the feed study, which is the basis for this agreement. The 1.1. If you look at the three years where the budgets, it's 1.1, 1.0, 1.4.
Speaker 5: But in the fee study on page 18, it says there'll be a significant reduction in hourly billable hours next year, 4000 hours less, which is about $250,000. The budget doesn't reflect that. So my question is how will this savings be granted to the city of Alameda with this agreement?
Speaker 5: So it doesn't look like there's a way to get that money back. So please figure out a way to fix it so that when they do less hours, we don't have to pay for it. And when that 1.11.2 budget, we don't have to pay.
Speaker 0: Thank you, city manager. We would like to respond to that.
Speaker 4: So how the agreement works now and it's similar to the phase agreement is it's on a reimbursement basis and then the fee schedule is calculated from the previous year. So you will if there's we have savings of 250,000, it will be reflected in the new fee schedule the following year.
Speaker 0: All right. Thank you. And this I just want to clarify this is this money would be paid for out of the general fund if currently how? How will this money be paid?
Speaker 4: It is currently paid out of the general fund by council direction. And what is on the agenda later on tonight is to have the fee study be charged to buy a unit for each of the units.
Speaker 0: And if that fails, then it would be paid for by as well. We're committing to this not knowing if that's going to pass, right?
Speaker 4: That's correct.
Speaker 0: Of what we.
Speaker 4: Have committed to do, the rent stabilization ordinance and the implementation of it, regardless of the funding and the council direction will be we'll hear later on tonight.
Speaker 0: Thank you.
Speaker 6: Ever matter of approval of this? We have to do this.
Speaker 0: All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you. So now we're on our regular agenda items. Okay.
Speaker 1: 6 a.m. introduction of ordinance, approving a lease and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement the terms of a lease with sale drone a Delaware corporation for a five year lease with two five year extension options and a right of first negotiation for the purchase of Building 12 located at 1050 Westheimer Avenue at Alameda
Speaker 1: Point.
Speaker 9: Good evening, mayor and city council members I'm Nanette Mercado in the community development and based we use department. This is sale drone is a tenant that's been operating out of building 12 for since 2016th February 2016. It came to us as part of the America's Cup.
"
"Speaker 5: Oh, right. So next step is report of the committee reports. Will the clerk please read? Agenda item one.
Speaker 2: The report The City Council Agenda and one Council Bill 119 720 and many ordinance 125 724 which adopted the 2018 budget, including that 2019 through 2024 capital improvement program. The committee recommends that the bill passes amended.
Speaker 5: I just need a minute to get to my remarks here. All right. So Council Bill 119720 is the fourth quarter 2019 Supplemental Budget Ordinance, which proposes adjustments to the 2019 adopted budget, including appropriation authority for the grants accepted by Ordinance 126023, which was adopted by Council last month on December 16th.
Speaker 5: This ordinance would appropriate approximately $132.7 million, of which $101.6 million is for operations and $31.1 million is for capital. The operations appropriations include approximately $16.7 million or 16.4% from the general fund, of which $8.6 million are grant funded.
Speaker 5: This was an ordinance that was heard in the former Finance and Neighborhoods Committee, and the that committee recommends that the City Council pass as amended this council bill. 119720. Are there any comments or questions? Okay. Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill?
Speaker 2: Herbold. I. Suarez.
Speaker 3: Lewis, i.
Speaker 2: Morales, i. Peterson. I so want strauss. I. Council President Gonzalez. All right. Eight in favor. Nine opposed.

"Speaker 3: Motion case.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Item 36 Communication from Councilmember Supernova. Recommendation to Increase Appropriations in general fund in the Development Services Department by 150,000 to support the funding of a hospital architect to determine seismic compliance at community hospital.
Speaker 1: Councilor. Mr. Brown. Thank you. This important issue and it is very time sensitive. So that's the reason for the amount and the urgency here. And I appreciate my colleagues support and thank you to my very hard working staff who made these moneys available.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Pearce. Okay. Public comment on this cut from Franco. Yeah. I just want to thank Superman for his championing the cause for keeping community hospital open. And I think that this fund, these funds would go a long way in trying to get the hospital.
Speaker 1: Stay there. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Murchison. I concur. I mean, this is big, too. This is evidence of why we need to make sure that we continue to support one time funds by council district. You're able to show leadership on the important issues that are important to your district and put your money where your mouth is
Speaker 1: . So, you know, I would just encourage I don't think that you should be the only one to have to do that. It's important. So cities, you know, city staff, city manager, if there's another way to pony up plenty of those funds, you know, they'll be good to say.
Speaker 1: District nine. I mean, I just don't think that it has it should necessarily I think it's great that he puts it up, but we should we should have a matching system. This is going to be about 300, about 300 to 3 50,000.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, that's good. But I mean, the council is not just ponying up, it's seed money and we'll be filling in as well. Thank you, Mr. West City. That asset, I think Tina is a great place to look.
Speaker 1: See? No public comment. There's a mention in a second. Please cast your votes.
Speaker 3: Motion carries.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I think that concludes the items on the agenda that are necessary. And I wasn't here for the first part of the meeting. I got them all back. Is there a second public comment or anyone that has not spoken on an item is not on the agenda seeing none.
Speaker 1: Nope. Please come forward. Come forward, please. Just for clarification, Ken, can I congratulate.
"
"Speaker 2: Agenda Item nine Resolution 31802 regarding civil legal aid project with the King County Department of Public Defense and its scope of Work for Representation Services, the committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Herbold.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So in the 2016 budget process, this council supported funding for what we're calling the Collateral Consequences attorneys as part of a city funded legal aid pilot program. The pilot program has been created to prevent people from losing their housing and having other collateral consequences when they are in the midst of a legal defense for an
Speaker 2: unrelated offense. Prior to the pilot, the attorneys at the King County Public Department of Public Defense under contract with the city to provide statutorily required defense services, were actually prohibited from working to address these collateral consequences. The creation of this pilot has allowed specialized staff with the King County Department of Public Defender to advocate for the accused
Speaker 2: , keep their housing during the legal review and plea bargaining processes. Stage two of this pilot anticipates the inclusion of direct representation of King County Department of Public Defense's criminal justice clients in civil proceedings with a primary focus on eviction.
Speaker 2: The there are other areas that the pilot focuses on in addition to eviction, as we heard during public comment, some of them ranging from intervening on behalf of a defendant's rights to maintain their their their employment licensing requirements, financial support services such as disability, as well as other types of civil civil issues that that come up during
Speaker 2: the during the course of a of a defense. Last month, I convened a group of civil legal aid stakeholders, as well as tenant services providers in order to talk about the progress of the pilot program. The between July and December of 2017.
Speaker 2: There were 293 cases where Collateral Consequences attorneys were used, and the folks meeting with us last month helped to influence and shape the resolution that you have with you in front of you today. One of the amendments that we raised during the committee process to specifically incorporate feedback would be outlining an intention to regularly convene a civil
Speaker 2: legal aid coordination group in order to bring together the attorneys providing legal aid with the actual service providers that these cases touch in some ways. As you heard today in public comment, the services provided by this pilot have real life implications for decreasing unreasonable consequences for people who have been charged and not convicted with a crime.
Speaker 2: It is modeled on the Bronx Defender approach towards public defense, which recognizes that these services must be provided in a way that's holistic in order to avoid future negative impacts arising from from the the collateral consequences of some of these cases.
Speaker 2: So look forward to having councilmembers support on this resolution, which will help set out the steps for the next stages of this pilot, which move from the consultation of the public defenders with the collateral consequences attorneys to the direct representation in some cases.
Speaker 0: Excellent. Any further comments? I just like to think I'm sorry, Herbold, for bringing this forward as I'm very, extremely supportive. And I think the public testimony we receive from many of the attorneys involved in this to do a deeper dove on what's happening out there, these kinds of problems.
Speaker 0: And I think this is a great both policy strategy as well as well should be an investment strategy. Thank you for bringing that forward. Any further comments? But those in favor of adopting the resolution please vote i. I.
Speaker 0: Those opposed vote no. The motion carries and the resolutions adopted. The chair will sign it. Please read items ten and 11 together.
"
"Speaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. That concludes the questions or comments on this item. Madam Secretary, will you please put the next item on our screens, which should be 1177, which is the bill creating the Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency.
Speaker 0: And I just wanted to call this bill out to, again, thank all my colleagues, to thank the administration and to thank all of the citizens who pushed really hard for this and have been pushing us to elevate this conversation around climate change and pushing us to step up our response on this issue.
Speaker 0: This is a huge step in the right direction, but our work is not done here. We have a long way to go until we can say that we're doing everything that we need to do as a city to meet the science based targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Speaker 0: I look forward to seeing this office stood up and focused on this critical work, and I also look forward to the forthcoming Climate Task Force meetings and the hard work that that task force will undertake. Looking at what we are currently doing, what we what more we need to be doing and how we close that gap.
Speaker 0: And I look forward to this body continuing to push hard on this issue until we know that we are doing our part and everything that we can as a city to solve this global crisis. So, Councilman Hines, did you also want to make a comment or ask question?
Speaker 5: Well, no question. But I do want to make a comment. Mr. President, I want to thank you also for for pulling this out. And I want to thank my colleagues and everyone who's worked on this. I think this is a critical program I want to our initiative.
Speaker 5: I also want to mention I was fortunate to stand with the mayor, the governor, the lieutenant governor, the executive director of CDOT and Lyft. Last week when they unveiled that they are adding 200 electric vehicles to their fleet in the in the city.
Speaker 5: And I want to say, this is an example of how we should all do our part as individuals and as organizations to to to work to to make this a better planet to a cleaner planet and a more sustainable planet.
Speaker 5: And and so I think that even, you know, companies like Lyft should be celebrated. And and I think that they the governor and Lyft both last week gave a gentle challenge. I would bring the same thing again and say, we should all do our part, not just individuals, not just government agencies.
Speaker 5: But I love the gentle challenge that that left in the governor had companies we would love to support you in your quest to become more sustainable as well. Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. All right. That concludes the items to be called out this evening. All bills for introduction are ordered published, and we are now ready for the block vote on resolutions and bills on final consideration, except for Resolution 11 zero four concerning the 14th Street General Improvement District Resolution 11 zero five regarding Gateway Village General Improvement
Speaker 0: District and Resolution 11 zero six concerning the Reno Denver General Improvement District. After the recess, Council will hold separate public hearings on these three councilmembers. Remember, this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote.
Speaker 0: Otherwise, this is your last opportunity to call an item out for a separate vote. All right, Councilman, can we please put the resolutions for adoption in the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor?

"
"Speaker 0: All right. Thank you. Do a recap. Under resolutions, no items have been called out under bills for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. Council Member Cunneen has called out Bill 818 for comments under pending.
Speaker 0: No items have been called out. Madam Secretary, please put the first item on our screens. All right, we've got it up. Council member each. Please go ahead with your comments.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Council President Gilmore And this bill is an extension of a current executive order we have that protects workers who are doing essential services on city property for things like janitorial, security, etc. to be able to keep their jobs if the contractor they work for changes over as the city periodically rebuilds that work.
Speaker 7: But it also expands those protections to essential workers in more categories, particularly many of the workers at our airport who do baggage or clean aircrafts or push passengers with disabilities. So all of those workers who really we rely on and we came to understand during this pandemic how essential they really are.
Speaker 7: They showed up to work when they needed to to keep things running, or many of them lost jobs, as we, you know, dialed down the amount of service we needed in buildings. So in many ways, they were impacted in both ways.
Speaker 7: These protections are common sense. They are efficient. They help to make sure that we keep the security protocols high and that our city runs efficiently. They're good for businesses because you kind of have a ready made workforce when you start over rather than losing people who want to find new jobs before their contract turns over.
Speaker 7: We talked about it at length at committee, but I wanted to call it out because I think for me personally, this bill is a sign not only of this council's commitment that the airport and the mayor's office and all the administrative agencies who partner with us to look at all the details.
Speaker 7: But it's our city's commitment that the important benefits of the airport and the important benefits really do need to flow to everyone. I know we talk a lot about gentrification on this council and we talk about it in the housing sphere.
Speaker 7: And, you know, really the truth is that a good paying job that you can keep is also an anti gentrification or displacement force. At one point, the airport found that at least about a quarter of the folks who worked at the airport lived in Denver.
Speaker 7: We know that we're an employer for the entire region and that's a good thing. You know, it's good that we have enough jobs for residents of many communities. But if you think about it, those workers, many of them who live in far northeast Denver, many of them who live in west Denver, they are in their neighborhoods facing
Speaker 7: those rising housing costs, facing all the other challenges we talk about. And their ability to keep their jobs sustainably is linked to their ability to stay in our city, too. And so I believe that if we're going to be comprehensive, right, in thinking about our airport as an economic agenda or engine, that these policies that make sure
Speaker 7: that the jobs, first of all, are good jobs. Right. With the wages we described. Second of all, are sustainable jobs with policies like worker retention. And then third of all are just jobs. Right. That they have good voices on the job, are not fired for organizing or for being engaged in activities that are protected, that those types
Speaker 7: of things are what make that economic engine valuable to the regular people of Denver who may not be frequent fliers. Right. It's valuable to all of us as passengers. But that economic engine piece has to mean something to the workers at all incomes.
Speaker 7: And so I think this completes the vision. Right, these types of policies that we've been addressing. And so I want to thank the workers who came to testify during committee, the staff and the folks who represent them from Unite Here and SEIU Local 105 And I share this with my colleagues at committee.
Speaker 7: But, you know, this is a union neutral policy. The majority of workers who are protected by it probably aren't represented by a union. But these are policies that really fill in those gaps for all of those workers and make sure that they're on a level playing field.
Speaker 7: And so for that, I'm really proud that it's on the consent agenda tonight. There will be no dramatic vote count here, but I thought it was important because of what these workers have been through over the last year, because of how really collaborative and meaningful this conversation was, where all the players in our city agencies and council
Speaker 7: members and workers where we're working together. I want to thank the airlines who participated in the conversation and gave us feedback that resulted in some changes, but I just thought it was worthy of comment before we passed it along in the consent agenda, I want to thank my colleagues for their support, especially you, President Gilmore, as the
Speaker 7: host of our airport, been very engaged in the conversation. So thank you to all and look forward to the consent vote.
Speaker 0: All right. Thank you very much, Councilmember Kinney, and likewise, want to thank the folks that are working at it, Dan, and the leadership at the airport as well. But then also, I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for your leadership and partnership, especially in working with Unite Here and SEIU as well, and so happy to
Speaker 0: support this tonight. It's important and it stabilizes our families in the community and also the airport as well. All right. Not seen any other items called out. That concludes that recap portion. All bills for introduction are ordered published.

"
"Speaker 8: Agenda Item ten Council Bill 1186 11 relating to the permissions granted to Fremont Dock Company by ordinance 121706 to use and occupy a portion of Fremont every north under the Fremont Bridge north approaching lying north of the Lake Washington ship canal and south of the former Burlington Northern Main Line.
Speaker 8: Right of way. Committee recommends double pass.
Speaker 5: Trying to be recognized.
Speaker 1: I can't remember, Brian.
Speaker 5: If I went first, I would get in trouble. So. So this is underneath the Fremont Bridge on the north side. The, uh. The city owns the footprint underneath the bridge, but doesn't actually own access to it. And so this swaps some of the square footage underneath the bridge in exchange with the Fremont Company, in exchange for access
Speaker 5: underneath it and around the edges of it. The there's no money that changes hands because the value of the swap was valued to be about equal. We did notice just to the last minute that there were a couple blanks on this bill and one typo that needed to be corrected.
Speaker 5: So I would like to move to amend Council Bill 118611, Section ten a first sentence by deleting these tags and adding this to this and then filling in the blank with council bill number 118611 and then also in section 13 C by filling in the blank with council bill number 118611.
Speaker 1: Thank you. It's been moved to a second. Thank you, Councilmember Brian, I believe before we entertain that amendment, I'm going to have to suspend the rules. And so I will need to suspend the rules to consider this amendment, since it wasn't previously circulated to us by 12 noon.
Speaker 1: So I moved to suspend Council Rule three, a62 considered an amendment to Council Bill 118611 that was not previously circulated. So all those in favor of the suspension of the rule vote i. I those opposed vote no, the motion carries.
Speaker 1: And now we could proceed with the consideration of the amendment that has been moved and seconded already. All those in favor of the amendment vote i. I. I. Those polls vote nay or no. The motion carries and we should proceed with consideration of the amendment.
Speaker 1: Uh, is there any further comments you would like to say on the underlying bill? It comes from Brant. Are we good to go?
Speaker 5: Good to go for my.
Speaker 1: Okay, so please call the rule on the passage of the amended bill.
Speaker 2: Whereas I O'Brien. Hi. On Major Gonzalez Herbold Johnson, President Harrell Aden favor and unopposed.

Speaker 11: Look until 701 Cedar Avenue. I just had a quick question if you guys could ask this. Does this basically mean that that the moneys would go back to the gas company and that there would be an increase in rates or an increase to recover the subsidy?
Speaker 11: I know that there is a a global warming tax credit that I got on my energy bill. I'm wondering if that should.
Speaker 0: Have Mr. Gardner clarify that.
Speaker 4: What's going to happen is we're required, as of January 1st.
Speaker 1: To enter into the greenhouse gas program and purchase emission allowances.

Speaker 7: Thank you, Madam President. As you know, I have stated my concerns about the use of on call contracts among members agencies a number of times. I believe that the practice of setting aside money for certain vendors without any additional information or reporting requirements to City Council regarding the scope of the work being done subverts the intent of
Speaker 7: our Charter. Council has been explicitly given the authority to approve contracts over $500,000, and this practice doesn't provide transparency or accountability, which I believe my residents expect from their government, although DOT has changed their practices around on call in response to these concerns.
Speaker 7: These particular contracts are for on call contracts for Parks and Rec. They don't provide reports to council on the contracts at all. I've already had a conversation with them about this and they are working to make some changes as well, which I very much appreciate.
Speaker 7: But I am a no tonight. Thanks.
Speaker 1: All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. Councilmember Hines, I think.
Speaker 8: Thank you. Council president. I did put Gary on notice that I also did not enjoy the on call contracts, but I told them before I voted no. So I'll be a yes tonight. I sure would like for Parks to emulate what Daddy has started to provide us.

"Speaker 5: Agenda item 12 Resolution 31637. Recognizing the obstacles faced by previously incarcerated individuals that often result in recidivism and the potential to reduce recidivism rates, criminal justice costs and incarcerations. Negative impacts on individuals, the community and the city of Seattle.
Speaker 5: Requesting the Mayor to establish a prisoner and Community Corrections Reentry Work Group composed of residents, city departments, the Seattle Municipal Court and the Legislative Department to coordinate and strengthen the city's efforts to assist prisoner community reentry. The committee recommends that the Council, the resolution, be adopted.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.
Speaker 3: Thank you very much. So this resolution calls on city departments to convene a prisoner and community corrections reentry work group to coordinate and strengthen the city's efforts to assist formerly incarcerated people who reenter our communities. And this workgroup will consist of residents and city departments and municipal court representative and our legislative department and great leaders like Murph
Speaker 3: . Thank you for being here, Mayor, for this piece of legislation. Basically, this working group will assess collection of fees and fines for criminal violations and infractions and how and how they impact successful reentry into our communities. The work we'll be doing will identify areas where the city's efforts could be strengthened by more effective coordination with other criminal
Speaker 3: justice agencies and develop a set of additional policies and ordinances and strategies to help us implement and facilitate prisoner reentry. This resolution is asking city departments to explore the creation of a Certificate of Restoration of opportunity, otherwise known as a crop.
Speaker 3: And many of you are aware of the work dealing with a crop in the state legislature. And so we will explore that. If the state legislature does not pass one in the upcoming legislative session, it is part of our agenda.
Speaker 3: We are hopeful, but we will be prepared of things in a short session. Do not go the way we want them to. This workgroup will report back to the Council by the end of February 2016 with an initial report, and the final report is due September 1st, 2016.
Speaker 3: Now, why are we doing this? What is this resolution all about? Well, we know in 2015, approximately 2.2 million people were incarcerated nationally, a 500% increase in the last 30 years. We speak at our committee and in our communities about the massive incarceration of many communities locally.
Speaker 3: In 2015, 16,675 adults were incarcerated in Washington State prisons, and a further average of 12,618 people per day were placed in local jails, with 2800 being jailed right here in King County. So in 2014, about 20% of the almost 8000 individuals released from Department of Corrections were released right here in our county.
Speaker 3: People of color are disproportionately represented among those released in King County. A study demonstrated while African-Americans were only 6% of the King County's population, 41% of people released from the Department of Corrections were African-American. And while Latinos were only 6% of King County's population, 18% of those people released from DC were Latinos.
Speaker 3: This work is needed. These policies are needed. This resolution heads us in the right direction as just this work we will be doing. And I personally believe that how cities and counties deal with the reentry of those who have been in custody will determine largely the fate and success of these cities.
Speaker 3: And I think this is important policy work that we must do. The committee recommends passage of this legislation.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? All in favor of adopting Resolution 31637 vote. I opposed vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted and the chair will sign it. Please read item 13.
Speaker 5: Agenda item 13. Resolution 31632.

"
"Speaker 0: Okay. So we're going to do the consent calendar minus item number 13. Is any public comment on the motion saying no members, please cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you. Item 13, please. Craig back.
Speaker 2: Good evening, Vice Mayor, Member City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to address this item. There is a a incorrect date listed on the council letter and just wanted to read that into the record so we make sure we have the correct date.
Speaker 2: The council letter is for an easement right of way connected to 4951 Oregon Avenue. In the staff report, we talk about when the secret document came forward and what's listed as May 9th, 2017. That was a mistake by staff.
Speaker 2: That was actually the date that we brought forward the track map for the development project. The actual secret document came forward in November on the 10th in 2015. So we wanted to read that in the record to make sure it accurately reflects when the secret document was approved so we can move this item forward.
Speaker 2: That concludes that report. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Fantastic. Thank you. Any public comment on this item saying no members, please cast your vote.
Speaker 1: Councilman Urunga. Motion carries.
"
"Speaker 3: Thank you. Agenda Item seven Council Bill 118443. Relating to the rates, terms and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the satellite department to customers in the city of SeaTac and amending SeaTac.
Speaker 0: Thank you Councilmember. So on trying to help you out there. Yes.
Speaker 6: This item also accompanies item number nine. I will go ahead and speak to vote. So I'm speaking to item number seven and nine. City Light has negotiated the new franchise agreement with the City of SeaTac. These are 15 year agreements and you may have noticed that they have all been expiring and have been renegotiated recently.
Speaker 6: There's a standard agreement and this is similar to those standard agreements. There's one thing that's notable. There's something called a consideration payment, which can either be 4% or 6%. This is a fee that is assessed to the customers in that area.
Speaker 6: In this case, the customer is SeaTac. And satellite ads that feed and then hand that revenue over to the city similar to a tax. It has no impact on other customers outside the city. When Sea-Tac renegotiated their franchise agreement, they elected to switch from the 4% consideration payment to a 6% consideration payment.
Speaker 6: And that's why there are two kinds of those. This one adopts the new rates with the consideration payment, and item number nine will adopt a franchise agreement as a whole. And I just wanted to note that as I have advocated here in Seattle, I think the city of sea dogs should alter how they do rate to lessen
Speaker 6: the burden on working families. However, this is what Sea Deck has negotiated, so the Energy Committee unanimously recommends passage of the bill.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 1: Okamoto. Rasmussen I so want I back shot Goran I Harrill I look Carter I O'Brien and President Burgess nine in favor and nine opposed.
Speaker 0: The bill passes and the chair will sign it. And I have just signed the oil train resolution with the extra comma removed. Thank you. Councilmember Okamoto, please read item eight.
"
"Speaker 1: The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Report to the full council. Please read item number one.
Speaker 2: The report at the full council agenda item number one Council 118 549 relating to cable television, authorizing the mayor or the mayor's designee to enter into a renewed cable television franchise agreement with Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC, and authorizing the Chief Technology Officer to enter into other agreements for the purpose of implementing or administering the renewed franchise
Speaker 2: held December seven, 2015.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.
Speaker 3: Thank you very much. So by way of background, you may recall we held this legislation to have some more discussion. This is basically an ordinance which renews the ten year franchise agreement for Comcast. And I want to go into a little bit of detail about what we're able to get from Comcast for this franchise.
Speaker 3: And it's important to note that this is not an exclusive franchise. We have other franchises in the city with Wave and CenturyLink as well. I do want to say right at the beginning that I thank all of you for being here on even other issues.
Speaker 3: It's unfortunate that we don't have enough time for everyone to speak, but your presence here, we are honored by your presence and for you fighting for what you believe in. So do you apologize? We didn't have the opportunity to to hear from all of you.
Speaker 3: Anyway, let's get back to Comcast. So basically and again, I don't report that everyone sort of understands this. There are certain things the city can regulate and certain things they cannot. For example, the city cannot control Comcast prices.
Speaker 3: And that's something that always is people are concerned about. The city cannot control Internet service that's regulated by the federal government. And so in our franchise agreement, we're looking at one part of what they provide, which is the the cable piece in this particular agreement, what we were able to basically get in terms of our goal and
Speaker 3: you may recall that our goal is to improve competition, have strong customer service and consumer protections. So everything we do must be designed to protect the consumer. So we updated the cable code establishing new standards for all cable providers back in March.
Speaker 3: There you have discussions about our cable, our customer bill of Rights and response times and what a customer's rights are. If they're not being treated fairly by Comcast or others. In this particular agreement, we're able to make sure that Seattle joined Comcast's pilot program that they have for low income seniors.
Speaker 3: You're eligible for the Internet Essentials discounted Internet program. And so we're able to get that very recently because we observed and I should say we it's the executive of the Department of Information Technology and the City Council observed that similar traction was was occurred had occurred in Philadelphia.
Speaker 3: We're able to get that here. We're able to get the previously announced digital equity grant offer to Seattle from a one time $50000 to $100000 per year for five years. That's about $500,000 in additional benefits. We will partner with Comcast at the City of Seattle to help risk risk add youth, obtain devices such as laptop computers.
Speaker 3: We have $8 million in public educational and governmental access channel financial support for those those public services. We have a 30% discount on basic tier, low income subscribers, and we have 600 modems to nonprofit organizations that's valued at about $10 million.
Speaker 3: In short, we had our Department of Information Technology go toe to toe with Comcast to get as many community benefits and consumer protections as we could. I will sort of close by saying we've had lengthy discussions about Comcast role and obligation.
Speaker 3: Our community and the city takes those very, very seriously. We hear daily people complaining about Comcast wanting competition, wanting lower rates. And so we have done everything possible in the last several months trying to achieve that. Last, I will say that many of the benefits that we've gotten, because they were not directly cable related, came in this
Speaker 3: letter agreement that I think all of you now have either talked to legal counsel or have seen the letter. And so we do have opinions that this is about as binding as it can get, given the sort of the hand that we're dealt, the hand being some of these are non cable related through theories of the legal
Speaker 3: theories such as promissory estoppel or equal to stop and all these fancy terms that sort of describe what Comcast must do. We are comfortable that that letter, that December 7th letter's binding. So the committee recommends passage of this legislation.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Questions or comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 2: Guarded.
Speaker 0: By.

Speaker 2: GONZALEZ Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, as I mentioned last week, Turner, a subcommittee on the city wide mandatory housing affordability meeting. And this morning during council briefing, this council bill represents a set of technical changes to the citywide Mandatory Housing Affordability Ordinance that this fall council adopted in May of 2019.
Speaker 2: All of you attended that committee hearing last Monday and heard from Ali Pucci of Council Central Staff the particulars of the technical changes included in this version of the bill. So I won't belabor the point today, but those changes, as a reminder, are strictly limited to ensuring that the maps and code language reflect the appropriate payment levels
Speaker 2: for development capacity, as determined by the City Council and previous policy conversations, as well as making sure that all of the code language accurately reflects the many policy choices made by the City Council in its deliberations of the originally passed citywide mandatory housing affordability ordinance.
Speaker 2: Otherwise, there are no substantive policy shifts or modifications to those legislative policy decisions made by this City Council in May of 2019. With that being said, the Select Committee on Citywide may recommend to the full council adopt council bill 119500.
Speaker 0: Very good. Any questions or comments? Do not please call the role on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 4: Think confusing. Sorry about that.
Speaker 6: That's okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank our Parks Rec and Marine staff for assisting us with this project. This is a project that the Belmont Heights community has been working on for some time now, and the staff has been very creative and trying to find ways for us to obtain grant funding in order to
Speaker 6: be able to complete at least one phase of this project. And I want to thank their team and also the new team that's joined us from Public Works in trying to get this this additional money to help make this project a reality.
Speaker 6: There's very little opportunities for green space that currently exist in the third. And this is an opportunity for us to bring some green space to the third in an area that desperately needs it, and to turn what is considered by many to be a bit of an eyesore as it is currently not maintained and does not serve
Speaker 6: any useful purpose. So I'm excited about this project. It has been a priority project for me and it will continue to be a priority project for me. And I'm looking forward to early spring when we find out whether or not we were able to obtain any grant funds.
Speaker 6: And I want to thank George and his team for pursuing this on our behalf. Thank you.
Speaker 4: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? CNN council member Austin.
Speaker 9: Yes. I also wanted to comment again, this is this is great. And I think this is a great move forward for the the third district in the green belt there. An examiner I used to actually live a short distance away from there.
Speaker 9: And I remember when that that issue was debated significantly over whether or not they were going to put a housing development there or keep it as a green space. And so to have this move forward, to finally have some hopefully have some funds there to to develop that that space, I think, is really, really great.
Speaker 9: And I also want to commend Parks and Recreation for coming to the council with this to get the authority to to go out and get the grant. Because I think there's there's some consistency there that we need to continue to follow.
Speaker 9: Thank you.

"Speaker 0: The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with our agenda. So first matter on our agenda, item number one, finance and housing. The report on the Finance and Housing Committee. Please read the report.
Speaker 0: Agenda item one Resolution 31931. A resolution establishing a watch list of large, complex, discrete capital projects that will require enhanced quarterly monitoring reports for the 2020 calendar year. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended. Casper Mosquito.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. This resolution adopts the 2020 watch list of projects from the Cities Capital Improvement Program, for which the executive will provide quarterly reports. This is a list of 17 large, discrete, complex projects that will be subject to in-depth quarterly reporting this year.
Speaker 3: This watchlist was established, as you all know, I think, in by ordinance in 2018 after several projects had significant overruns and delays. Without the council or the public's knowledge involvement, including the $70 million overrun at the Seattle seawall and streetcar.
Speaker 3: So this watch list is a result of the hard work of my colleagues, Councilmember Herbold and former colleague Councilmember Johnson. Thank you for all of your work on this. And I'm excited that we were able to have an in-depth conversation in our committee.
Speaker 3: Add to the watch list. This watch list now contains projects that would like that. We would like to have additional oversight and transparency on making sure that there's clear scope and that we watch for shifting estimates in cost or uncertain capital funding plans.
Speaker 3: If there's ill defined operation costs, plans or other funding plans, we will be able to have clear, I think, heads up on that and be able to have the legislative branch weigh in on our perceived priorities, identify significant, significant questions and ask questions about scope, schedule and budget so that we can ensure that the public's dollars is
Speaker 3: being well accounted for and that we are on track to fulfilling the Council's desired outcomes for these projects. Happy to bring forward this resolution today and thank our colleagues from the Finance and Housing Committee for their work to make this resolution even better.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any more comments? Casper Hubbell. I just want to flag that. One of the things that we talked about in committee was a recognition that the intent of the resolution was for the Finance Committee to be the designated committee to hear the reports overall.
Speaker 0: But there is a hope that individual committees that have responsibility for capital improvement projects that are on the watch list, that those individual committee communities do a deeper dove on monitoring projects that are in the watch list and consider spending limitations where appropriate, as yet another way to enhance oversight, perhaps by using stage gating or budget provisos
Speaker 0: to have additional oversight on some of those projects. And thanks to Chair Mascara, I appreciate that. She has indicated that she also has interest in figuring out a way whether or not we can, as a council, identify some ways, some checks and balances on ourselves to make sure that that enhanced oversight is happening.
Speaker 0: We can't we can't rely totally on the Budget Office and we can't totally rely on our central staff. I think we have to also think creatively about ways that we can do our part in monitoring.
Speaker 5: Some of these projects.
Speaker 0: Thank you for your comments, Councilor Muscat, you want to make a motion?
Speaker 3: Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that the full council approve resolution 31931 as amended in the Finance and Housing Committee.
Speaker 0: Second motion and a second. With that, let's go to a vote. All those in favor say I. I don't suppose they know the ayes have it. Thank you. The resolution passes. Thank you. Let's go to item number two on the report of the Transportation Utilities Committee.

Speaker 0: Mr. Modica.
Speaker 3: I thank you. Kelly Clapper, director of Health and Human Services, will get the staff report.
Speaker 2: Good evening. Approximately 4250 people residing within the city of Long Beach are living with HIV. We have about 100 new cases each year and we have contract with the state of California for 28 years to provide care within the city of Long Beach.
Speaker 2: Our services include HIV, medical care, linkage and adherence to care and medications, health and risk reduction, education and health care navigation. We find that African-Americans and Latinos continue to be disproportionately impacted by HIV in our community. So this grant includes special allocation to support outreach services for HIV positive individuals of color and is geared toward engagement and
Speaker 2: retention in HIV, medical care and other support services. In addition, we received about 560,000 more dollars this round than we did in previous years. And for this is to increase staff, our staff capacity around early intervention services. They're really geared toward linking new positives with HIV, medical care, referral to the services they need.
Speaker 2: Health, education and literacy training to enable clients to navigate the HIV system of care. I'm open to any questions, and with that I conclude my report.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Austin?
Speaker 9: Yes. I want to thank you. Thank you. And congratulations to the health department. This this department is largely funded through through grants. Grants like this one that will go a long way to to helping many of our residents in the 4200 over 4200 residents living with HIV.
Speaker 9: It's pretty, pretty significant to go a long way to help them think.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Urunga.

And it was a big hit that the department took a few years ago when the the vehicle license fee went away that be used to fund
Speaker 1: a lot of these kinds of programs. And I'm very happy to see that the health department has not backed off from its mission to provide services. And that's what makes this health department great. And that's what makes this the city of Long Beach great and having its own health department to be able to respond to these types
Speaker 1: of services that are much needed in the community. And I and kudos to to the Director Collopy and to her staff for continuing to look for grants that provide a very much needed service to our communities in Long Beach.

"
"Speaker 2: Thank you. I will be moving on now to the next item, which will be item number 25.
Speaker 1: Please report from Public Works recommendation or request city attorney to prepare an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to speed limits on city streets citywide.
Speaker 2: Mr. Modica.
Speaker 7: The item before you is related to speed limits. As mentioned, we are available for a staff report if you want it.
Speaker 5: Otherwise we're ready with the recommendation.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry. Councilman Price.
Speaker 4: To do this because I know it's a late night, but. Mr. Lopez, can you just talk real briefly about how it is specifically in Belmont? Sure. That we came up with these recommendations or perhaps you can expand on what I miss here.
Speaker 4: It's my understanding that this has been a multiyear process where data has been collected and the speed, the recommended speeds have been warranted through national standards for speed design and roadway design standards. And that this is something that has been in the process for a number of years to get to this recommendation.
Speaker 4: The reason and if there's anything you want to add to that, please. But the reason I'm asking that is because we do have business owners in Naples that have been asking for a reduction of speeds on Second Street through Naples.
Speaker 4: And that's something staff is looking at. But they have to collect the data and they have to make sure the warrants are there to recommend it. And it could not have been just added on to this item. Does that sound about right to you?
Speaker 2: Yes. Actually, we have Carl Hickman. That's our city traffic engineer. That's our local expert. So if I can have Carl Hickman help me answer that question, Carl.
Speaker 5: Sure. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. And to answer your question, Susie, basically, you know, many of most of those streets and the Belmont Shore residents district, they have similar characteristics. They were all originally posted at 25 miles an hour.
Speaker 5: They are very narrow there. The GM metrics are very similar. The usage that is there is very similar. So all of these things make it appropriate, appropriate to designate the entire neighborhood as a common district. All of the speed surveys that we collected there show an 85th percentile speed between 19 and 23 miles an hour.
Speaker 5: Actually, 14 of the 18 were actually 22 miles an hour or less. So because so many common conditions exist per the vehicle code, we're able to create their residence district and change the speed limits, have a reduction down to 15 miles an hour for the entire group of streets.
Speaker 5: And we're talking CVC Section 22, three, five, 8.3. That allows us to do that per state law, and that's how we're able to accomplish that in the Belmont Shore area.
Speaker 4: Okay. And so having said all of that, that your team is still looking at speed reductions on Second Street through the area of Naples, and that is a process where you're collecting data, doing speed surveys and establishing the necessary warrants to make that recommendation, correct?
Speaker 5: Yes, Councilwoman, we're actually in the process of reviewing all of the speed surveys in the entire city. These speed surveys are required so that PD has a formal and legal process to enforce our speed limits. We have over 300 engineering and traffic surveys that we have to maintain, and these require a renewal on the five year basis
Speaker 5: . And sometimes we can also extend them seven or ten years. But yes, to answer your question, we will be reviewing those roadways as well at second and other areas as well throughout the entire city. And this is the first step in the process.
Speaker 5: And I can remind you all that we did pass a Safe Streets initiative back in July of last year. And this is part of our process to see where there are areas in the city where we can formally and legally reduce our speed limits to make our city's streets safer.
Speaker 4: Great. Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's when Austin. Is there a public comment on this item? No these cats votes.

Both council bills were posted on our introduction referral calendar a week ago, and they simply expand the utilities emergency assistance programs for
Speaker 2: struggling ratepayers for 2021. Our central staff analysts circulated a brief memo about both bills last week. In short, both bills are a helpful expansion of the emergency assistance programs during these difficult economic times. These ordinances are required even for these simple modifications just for 2021.

"
"Speaker 3: Agenda item for Council Goal 119803 requiring that certain uniformed peace officers do not cover with a mourning band the serial number that is engraved on their badge and section 3.28. 130. The code declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date.
Speaker 3: All might be forced out of the city council.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. I will move to pass Council Bill 119803. Is there a second?
Speaker 2: Thank.
Speaker 0: It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of this bill, so I am going to recognize you in order to address this item.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much. So today we're voting on Council Bill 11 9803, which will require officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers on a different part of the badge. Many, many constituents have contacted the council, alarmed that batch numbers were not visible in the two weeks following the murder
Speaker 1: of George Floyd. After I announced that I was drafting legislation, Chief Bass issued a directive to all officers to display their badge numbers while wearing mourning bands. I, of course, appreciate that order, but believe that this policy must be adopted into state city law.
Speaker 1: The legislation amends Section 3.28130 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was created after the 1999 WTO protests, when people noted at that time that they could not view the nametags of officers. So then former City Council member Peter Steinberg sponsored legislation to create a new section of the municipal code to require display of nametag.
Speaker 1: This legislation is emergency legislation. So it will go into effect immediately upon signature of the mayor within the next ten days. It would not have the additional 30 day waiting period for non-emergency legislation. The bill also requests that the Seattle Police Department work with all other law enforcement agencies whose police officers reasonably may be anticipated to enforce
Speaker 1: traffic or criminal laws in Seattle pursuant to Chapter ten point. Our CW to develop a policy that would require these peace officers when enforcing these laws to conform with requirements concerning badges, ID devices, departmental ID on uniforms and oral ID that is consistent with Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.28.130.
Speaker 1: The Seattle Police Department is required by Seattle City Council with a proposal for the policy by January 2021. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for that description and for introducing this important bill. Are there any comments or questions on this bill? Hey, I'm not hearing or seeing any. Again, I want to thank you, Councilmember Herbold. I think we have all discussed this bill quite a bit before today and do agree with the approach that you've described, which
Speaker 0: is which is about not just allowing this kind of policy to exist at the discretion of whomever might be the chief, but to actually make sure that this is made concrete and long lasting through through legislation. And, of course, a future council could disagree with their policy position and change that.
Speaker 0: But I think it's pretty clear that this council agrees very strongly that this should be the policy and that it should be codified in law and not just exist in a in a in a police manual or in a directive from from the chief.
Speaker 0: So appreciate the wisdom in nonetheless moving forward this legislation and appreciate you bringing this for our consideration. Because remember state I see that you raise your hand, please.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Council member Herbold, thank you for bringing forward this legislation. I just wanted to ask you a question, both as a sponsor of this legislation and as chair of public safety. We know that even after the chief issued that directive, we heard reports of individuals who are still recovering batch numbers.
Speaker 1: Can you remind folks what to do if they see that happen after this ordinance has passed and.
Speaker 0: What the process should be?
Speaker 1: It would be a violation of both MPD policy and city law. The Office of Professional Accountability has a a complaint process to investigate complaints of violation of city policy. And there's also the ability of an investigation, of the violation of city law to to go along the investigation of the violation of city city policy.
Speaker 1: I do want to note that batch numbers are in different places on different people's badges. Sometimes they're in the center and sometimes they're at the bottom. And I know that some of the examples of covered badge numbers that I saw after Chief Best's order had badges, had the had the tape through the middle, and there was actually
Speaker 1: a badge number at the bottom of the badge. And in some instances, I, of course, have not seen every example of every complaint. There are the this issue is is one of the sort of the the top ten issues that the Office of Professional Accountability is looking at as it relates specifically to the volume of complaints that
Speaker 1: they've received.
Speaker 0: Thank you. And either questions or comments. All right. Hearing that, I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 2: Peterson I.
Speaker 1: Want.
Speaker 2: Strauss i.
Speaker 1: Herbold i.

Speaker 0: Thank you so much. The bill passes and the chair will sign it and I ask that the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation. Okay, folks, we are now in the other business category of city council. I know of our agenda.
"
"Speaker 0: Agenda item eight Council Bill 120055 An ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2020 Surveillance Impact Report in 2020. Executive Overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of Video Recording Systems. The committee recommends the bill passes amended.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Councilor Petersen. As chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to address this item.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Colleagues, this is the last of these Council 120055 as your surveillance impact report covering an existing camera system used only at speed facilities. After adopting amendments, our committee unanimously recommended approval. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, are there any comments or questions from council members on the presentation and passage of this bill? And I must get up.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much. I am again sorry to ask some questions and I'm sure you dealt with committee but council member Petersen as chair of the committee, perhaps this is for you or the President pro tem as chair of public safety.
Speaker 0: Did I understand correctly that this is an existing technology that we're now approving? How come SPV had approval to use it prior to today's authorization?
Speaker 2: That is the nature of the beast. Councilmember Petersen.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure. This surveillance ordinance that was originally adopted in 2017 and then refined by Council President Gonzalez in 2018 and others, this is the process where it goes first, goes through the surveillance working group, the volunteer surveillance working group.
Speaker 1: The department puts together report. It's reviewed by the Information Technology Department just to scope out exactly what the technology does and what the concerns, whether it is surveillance has surveillance capabilities, what concerns might be what the litigants are to those concerns.
Speaker 1: And it works its way through this process to get to us. And then, like I said, the Office of the Inspector General continues to monitor this going forward.
Speaker 2: But the thing that is at that is the case for all of the technology that all of the departments currently use at the time of the passage of the surveillance ordinance. So that's what we when we talk about the retrospective technologies, we're talking about surveillance technologies that were purchased before the passage of the surveillance ordinance.
Speaker 2: Our expectation is that correct me if I'm wrong, Councilmember Peterson, is that there are no future purchases of surveillance technology moving forward because we want to the expectation is that we will have three or four kinds of policies as a requirement to permit the purchase.
Speaker 2: But we don't have that opportunity with things that were already purchased.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And as a.
Speaker 0: Follow up to that, maybe just to prompt or to confirm my my research as well, just because the department is using it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to authorize that. You've gone through the rigorous process in committee of evaluating the various questions and making sure that it conforms or that you have added the appropriate sideboards to
Speaker 0: make it align with the Council's the council's priorities. And thus it's not not just as a symptom of it being currently used and thus being authorized, but you have gone through this process with the robust input from the the committee whose name I'm forgetting right now to make sure that those questions have been answered.
Speaker 0: And then where there are additional side boards, you've worked on amendments and the Council also has the option to not authorize if we so deemed.
Speaker 3: Not.
Speaker 0: Necessary. Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were very thorough discussions at committee. We had at least two committee meetings on this.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, Councilmember Ms.. For your questions. Are there additional questions or comments on this item? Right. Seen done. Well, the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 3: Excellent. Yes. Strauss. Yes. Lewis.

Speaker 2: Yes, thank you, Mayor. And I also would like to echo that premise, Councilman, your anger, because I think programs, one of the most important programs offered in our city, and we have a few locations in our sixth district, you know, which are very, very busy.
Speaker 2: But all I'd just like to say that these programs do save lives and am very, very, you know, happy to support anything that they're concerned to do in any district in the city of Long Beach. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Councilmember Austin.
Speaker 5: Yeah. I'd also like to just congratulate the Department of Health and Human Services on receiving this grant. It's a sizable grant, $4.5 million. It's going to touch a lot of lives. But more importantly, I think it's our conscious right now that there are a lot of families in poverty in our city that that that are in need
Speaker 5: . And so this will go a long way to address that. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Public comment on the item. Say nonmembers, please cast your votes.

"Speaker 3: Three per the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee Agenda Item 11 Council 119 236 Relating to low income housing modifying the 2016 Housing Levy Acquisition and Preservation Program described as an Ordinance 1250 28 amended administrative and financial planning for the 2016 Housing Levy and the housing funding policies for the 2016 housing levy and other funding sources
Speaker 3: , each as adopted by ordinance 125308 amending Ordinance 125 493, which amended the 2018 Budget by revising budget summary level proposed statements authorizing the Director of Housing to use 2016 housing levy funds to acquire options and ratifying confirming certain prior acts.
Speaker 3: The committee recommends the bill passed.
Speaker 0: Council Member Skater.
Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. And Council Bill 119236 passed unanimously out of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee. This legislation amends the housing funding policies which allow for strategic acquisition and including acquiring options by the Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development.
Speaker 7: So to break that down, that means that the Office of Housing is able to use the Acquisition and Preservation Program resources to purchase property and secure it for critical, long term, affordable housing development opportunities. Most immediately, as you heard, that this amendment will be able to help facilitate the acquisition of two Seattle satellite owned substations by the
Speaker 7: Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development. I think we all know that this is a critical, important step for us to take in an effort to make sure that there's more affordable housing options. It accomplishes multiple goals.
Speaker 7: First, increasing affordable housing locations with a near major transit investments throughout our city, and those investments that are expected to come online soon. Number two, increasing access to neighborhoods with little to no existing affordable housing options. Number three, promoting anti displacement and stabilization goals.
Speaker 7: And fourth, pursuing site assembly that leverages existing public property. This all means that when we see a piece of property, a piece of real estate that's on the market, we can act with urgency to make sure that the city can acquire it.
Speaker 7: This quickness is needed to make sure that we acquire properties that are often to too quick to go in this hot market. They go quickly and we want to make sure that the city has every tool in its tool belt to be a competitor and get those pieces of property in hand.
Speaker 7: At the same time, we want to make sure that all parcels of publicly owned land stay in publicly owned hands. This will help us be more equipped to make sure that we are both developing and preserving housing to meet our community's needs, especially for low income and moderate income families.
Speaker 7: As I mentioned this morning, I think this is an incredible addition to the work that we will be talking about later this evening in the conversation around the progressive tax and in the conversations that are ongoing around expanding MJ throughout the city.
Speaker 7: I want to thank the Office of Housing for working with our office, specifically Michael Maddox, and for Central Staff's work to bring this legislation forward. Thank you to Tracy and for all the work that's gone into this. I think this is a great tool.
Speaker 7: It might not sound very exciting acquisition of financing, but it's a really critical tool for our efforts to make sure that there's affordable housing and affordable land throughout the city.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much for the comments. Caspar Herbold.
Speaker 6: I just wanted to thank Councilmember Musgrave for bringing forward this amendment. I too have a Seattle City Light substation in my district that community members in the Highland Park area are very, very interested in the Office of Housing acquiring for the development of housing.
Speaker 6: But because of the zoning in the neighborhood, it is considered to be a site for increased zoning capacity under MSA. But even under that increased zoning, because of the the size of the parcel, there was some concern that it might not pencil out if a low income housing provider had to pay for the site acquisition as well
Speaker 6: . So I'm hopeful that now that we can bring some different assumptions to what the development costs will be for this particular location, the do more station, that this could be a site that the Office of Housing could look at in the future.
Speaker 6: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Okay, good. I think we're ready to vote, so please call the roll on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 1: Johnson. Whereas macheda I. O'Brien I want I. Make sure I. Gonzalez, I. Herbold hi. President Harrell.
Speaker 0: Hi.

"Speaker 1: Report from Public Works recommendation to execute a Fourth Amendment to contract with concrete construction for concrete repairs and related improvements, increasing the contract amount by an additional $5 million citywide.
Speaker 0: There's a motion in the second. Councilman Andrews, do have any comments or. No? Okay. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 2: It just. Just a quick question of our public works director. Why do we need to increase the contract? Sorry. Can you repeat the question? So we we are increasing the contract by an additional 5 million. Can you just for the benefit, tell us why?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. This is our annual contract for sidewalks. We do about you allocate about $3 million every year to do our concrete sidewalks. We also use the same company to do our ADA ramps. So there's another half a million that we use.
Speaker 2: And also we utilize this company to provide additional concrete services for paving alleys. They have the cheapest dollar per square foot unit price right now and we also use them for multiple areas in parking lots or any areas that we need to provide concrete work.
Speaker 2: So they have basically kept their unit prices for the last three years. Thank you for that explanation.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any public comment on this item? CNN, please cast your votes.
Speaker 1: Motion carries.

"
"Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Please put the next item on our screens. And Councilman New. Go ahead with your comment on this one.
Speaker 4: There's someone here from Parks. Right?
Speaker 6: Mm hmm. Michael Bouchard, Denver Parks and Rec.
Speaker 4: Mike. Everybody in Congress Park is so excited about that pool and you see so many comments and feedback and I'm so glad this is coming through tonight and looking forward to the development of that new pool. Congressman, so I appreciate all you're doing to keep it open this year and help design it.
Speaker 4: Just want to ask you question is how you're going to include the community in the involvement of the design process. Please?
Speaker 6: Sure. So we are intending to begin our public process this summer while the pool is still open. And we're targeting a date in late July or early August on the weekend to get down there when families are out enjoying the pool and get some real active feedback from them before it closes for the summer.
Speaker 4: That's great. Well, it's going to be a real asset once it's developed, so we're really looking forward to it. So thank you. Thank you very much. Okay.
"
"Speaker 2: Yeah. Item number 12, communication for Mayor Robert Garcia. Recommendation to receive and file a report from the mayor on the city's involvement in the Long Beach College promise.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Just briefly, I know we have a long night. I just wanted to check in with the council and obviously let them know that the city has been working actively working with our education partners on the Long Beach College promise.
Speaker 1: There has been a lot of interest. Education, as most know, is at the top of the priority list of issues that I'm pursuing and ensuring that we are working with our school district as much as possible. With us today, we do have two of our school board members.
Speaker 1: I see Dr. Feld Williams is in the audience, as is Megan Kerr. I know that Chris Steinhauser is at another meeting. He was going to try to swing by. I'm not sure if he'll be able to make it or not.
Speaker 1: But I want to just say that the city has been active and becoming a full partner as part of the college promise, which we all know, which is very exciting. I also want everyone to know that the college promise continues to be a national model.
Speaker 1: Recently, a members of the heads of all of our institutions were in Washington, D.C., receiving awards and and accolades about the success of our Long Beach program. And what we're excited about here in Long Beach is not just supporting the current work the College Promise does, which is clearly focused on student success, which is focused on retention
Speaker 1: , which is focus on ensuring that Long Beach Unified School students have access to a community college or a Cal State University education. But we're also focused on ensuring that those institutions have a support from the city. In addition to that, we had discussions with all of our university and school school partners about additional goals as part of
Speaker 1: the college promise. One of them is a goal of trying to trying to attain universal preschool enrollment for Long Beach. We all know that research shows that there's no better investment than a preschool education for young for young people.
Speaker 1: And we want to ensure that every family in Long Beach, regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live, have access to preschool. In addition, as we all know, when a family is able to enroll a young child in preschool, the family also has the ability then to have child care and then possibly go to work or
Speaker 1: pick up that second job or work with other members of their family and spend time. So it really is an economic benefit as well. The second major initiative, which we're all working on very aggressively, is to double the amount of internships in the city for Long Beach High School and college students.
Speaker 1: We are actively pursuing this goal. We think we will be able to double them in this first year, hopefully, certainly by the first or second year. But our goal is this first year. And that is something that the unit that the university, the community college and Lambert Unified are all actively, actively working on.
Speaker 1: And so we're incredibly excited about this process. We expect that sometime in the spring, we'll be able to come to the council with a very detailed report on on how everything is moving forward. And tonight, there's two items on the agenda tonight.
Speaker 1: So this so this item is just a a brief report that I wanted to give. And then there's a second item, which is actually the city council passing a resolution in support of the promise. And so with that, I want to get a motion to first receive and filed this report.
Speaker 1: Is there any public comment on this report? KC Nunn I'd like to ask. I know there's some members queued up. Did you all want to wait for the second item to speak? Okay, so why don't we do that?
Speaker 1: Is that's the resolution? And I also am going to call up r our two school board members at the start of the next item for public comment. And so with that, if we can get a motion, we can cast their votes for the receive and file item before we move on to the resolution.
Speaker 2: Motion carries six zero.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And, Madam Court, can you read the next item?
Speaker 2: Item number 13 Communications from Council Member Robert Ringer, Vice Mayor Susie Lowenthal, Councilwoman Susie Price and Councilman Rex Richardson. Recommendation and request. Request City Attorney to draft a resolution in support of joining the Long Beach College Promise as a formal partner with Obie, USD, IPCC and CSU.
"
"Speaker 3: So I'm looking forward to that then be included in that process. So thank you to everyone that spoke and let's move on to the rest of the agenda. Let's do item ten, please.
Speaker 4: Report from Human Resources recommendation to adopt a resolution approving an exception to the 180 day waiting period for public agencies to hire Maria or Maria for a limited duration to work in the Technology and Innovation Department citywide.

Speaker 10: Please. Agenda item number 12, Resolution 31694 relating to Seattle Public Utilities, establishing a customer review panel to provide input to the 28 2018 through 2023 Strategic Business Plan Update.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Herbold.
Speaker 6: Thank you. Ordinarily, we would send this resolution to my my utilities committee for discussion, but we are working on a quick turnaround. The Seattle Public Utilities has a desire to get this review panel up and running. So we're sending it directly to full council without committee review.
Speaker 6: Just some quick background. Seattle Public Utilities has a six year strategic business plan. It's updated every three years. SPU expects to submit a new 2018 2023 proposed plan to council by mid-May 2017. When SPU developed its last plan, the Council directed SPU to create a customer review panel to provide input into that plan.
Speaker 6: And at the time, the panel was composed of nine members, five appointed by the mayor and four appointed by the council. The panel dissolved once the council adopted the 2015 2020 plan. This is an effort to reconstitute that committee.
Speaker 6: In addition to this panel, the utility also has three additional ongoing customer advisory committees, one for each water, solid waste, drainage and wastewater.
Speaker 0: Thank you for the comments about this resolution. I move to adopt resolution 3169. For those in favor of adopting the resolution, vote I those opposed vote no. The motion carries and resolutions adopted. The chair will sign it next.
Speaker 0: Agenda Item.

"Speaker 1: I think there are two correct. There are. You want to get to them together because the item is for the same reasons I would move ordinance 2018 0456 and also Ordinance 2018 0457 together. Great. And just by way of a high level overview, both these ordinances would give the executive authority to enter into local agreements for construction
Speaker 1: of and maintenance of trail segments with our partner jurisdictions.
Speaker 0: Very good port and project. How's it going to end up as it is it happening? It's progressing. Okay. Councilmember Patterson was big on this, I think to make this trail happen. I'm saying not everybody's happy with this legislation.
Speaker 0: All right. Let's call the roll on those two items, 13 and 14 proposed ordinances, 2018 04560457.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, the two chair. I believe there may be amendments.

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right. That's obsolete. So should these packets be by the way? But anyway, so to ordinance 2018 0456, which I previously moved, I would move Amendment one and can I move them together now? We'll do it separately in.
Speaker 0: Favor of Amendment one. Say I, I any opposed? Number one hangs.
Speaker 1: Yeah. With respect to Ordinance 2018 0457, which I previously moved, I would also move Amendment one on favor.
Speaker 0: Amendment one, say i, i any opposed Amendment one to the second, ordinance four as hangs now to the underlying ordinances as amended, the clerk will call the roll.

Speaker 3: What was it at that point? I said to them, were you? I'm not positive. But we entered into a document at that time and there will be a delegation now in November going from here to there. And we have some members in the audience that will be attending.
Speaker 3: Myself, I'll be going. I have a daughter that will be joining us. And then if you all want to come up and introduce yourselves and speak to this, you're more than welcome to.

Speaker 5: So I hope that you all approved that. Thank you very much. We're all excited. We will be reporting back. I'm sure.
Speaker 3: So. Thank you. Do we have a motion?
Speaker 1: I would move the motion to authorize the mayor to sign the memorandum of understanding with our sister city in Dumaguete to the Philippines.

"
"Speaker 2: Believe item 18.
Speaker 1: Oh, there's one more.
Speaker 2: 18 It's so report from Public Works Department with the recommendation to award a contract to veneer construction management for service management services for the North Branch Library Project in amount not to exceed $1.197 million.
Speaker 1: Some of it has been in motion. And a second and yes.
Speaker 7: I just want to say something about the library. So. Oh, sure. So quickly. So we had some challenges with Fire Station 12 and its construction. It's particularly important that we have construction management on this library. I think folks should know that we've you know, we've taken our time to select a construction manager to ensure that we we
Speaker 7: do the right thing and we don't have to run into the problems we ran into with Fire Station 12. The date for the for the fire station for the library groundbreaking will be will be within this next month.
Speaker 7: So it's a very exciting time. Now, this is the last agenda item for the library until we see some some shovels in the ground. So thank you.
Speaker 1: Oh, great. There's been a motion. Any public comment on this item? Mr. Goodhew. Very good. Your clinic has addressed, obviously, supporters of finance for libraries. My mother was a librarian, actually went earned her degree about a decade and a half earlier or before.
Speaker 1: Eleanor Schmidt, who was our librarian for almost two and a half decades here. Also my great great uncle who I never met but designed our is main library. I fully support this. I'm hoping you can find some money at some point in time and I'm going to recommend that you buy that they.
Speaker 1: One of the first books they buy there and then have an average library. This book called The Boys in the Boat. In fact, I've recommended to Mr. Steinhauser that it be required reading it put on the required reading list or social studies in the Long Beach Unified School District.
Speaker 1: It is a fantastic book about what it is. It's a story about the 1936 Olympic eight, the gold medal boat. But it is much more than that. It is a fantastic recount of what life was like in the Depression area era up in Washington and across the country.
Speaker 1: It's got you can Google of sight and you can see it. You can actually see a two and a half minute video of the final race in Berlin. But again, it's called Boys in the Boat. I think every single council person should read it.
Speaker 1: I think, as I say, I think it will be read in the schools. I know every athletic coach, regardless of the sport, will read it. But it's just a fantastic, well-written it's well-written account of the struggles of the average American family back in the Depression and the economic hard times they face, which will probably resonate with a
Speaker 1: lot of people today. And so they get a good perspective of what life was back in the United States, although it does center in the northwestern part of this country again. Boys in the boat. Google it. You can read the reviews and you can even see the the video of black and white, the final race in Berlin
Speaker 1: . Thank you. Thank you. And let's I want to make sure that we're trying to keep the comments to the item at hand. The North Library.
Speaker 6: Will.
Speaker 1: Surely be installed.
Speaker 6: That book will.
Speaker 1: Be in the library. Right. That was that was that was the connection. You have libraries where they have books. Thank you. I did not.
Speaker 7: Know. Would you mind donating that book to the library?
Speaker 1: I'll. I will. This is somebody else's copy. I will. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Moving on. There is a motion on the floor. However, there anyone that has any comments and I think these people are queued up for new business.

"Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. As you may recall, at the mayor council meeting where we discussed this, I had inquired as to the the record of of response times in my district in southwest Denver. And other members may also be interested, but I would like to know if it's possible by next week, if we can get a breakdown
Speaker 8: of the statistics that staff got us by council by at least by my council district. And also, this is a short extension. And when this contract comes up again next year to rebid, might the administration consider putting it out to bid by quadrants of the city so that we can have towers who can respond more quickly in
Speaker 8: southwest Denver? So my question was, can we have information broken down?
Speaker 2: All right. Here.
Speaker 4: We're going to have Melissa Baldwin from. Thank you for that.
Speaker 3: Good evening. We're still working on trying to break out our data by districts. The city agencies that use this don't keep data themselves. So we're relying on the vendor to try to break out all that data.
Speaker 8: Thank you very much. And you had two categories and what these are overwhelming statistics. 15,000 tows last year, but 12,000 of those were impound tows. What were the other 3000, if you know.
Speaker 3: Those are city vehicle tows. Okay.
Speaker 8: Thank you. That's all.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Flynn.
Speaker 10: Councilman knew I was also just concerned about the overall financial situation with the towing service and support. Councilman Flynn And just really like to get some information which I expressed the Mayor Council but the overall break even point of this program.

"
"Speaker 1: Lucky Number 0259 Council on Me here in Arroyo offered the following an ordinance amending City of Boston Code Ordinances, Chapter 15, Section ten, and establishing the Boston Fair Chance.
Speaker 0: To be chair. Recognizes Councilmember. Here, Councilmember. Here you have the floor.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to Kelso Arroyo and his staff for co-sponsoring this docket alongside of our office, the city of Boston employees, nearly 20,000 people to do all sorts of jobs, from parking attendants to EMS workers to sewer workers and more.
Speaker 3: There are a few things in our city that aren't made better by the work of our city employees. We saw during the last storm how essential our Boston Public Works employees really are. And for many of them, this isn't just about collecting a paycheck.
Speaker 3: Their jobs aren't just what they do. It's who they are. Over the past several months, I have been in deep communication and meeting with these workers to learn about their experiences working for the city. In each meeting, we heard the same story.
Speaker 3: Workers of color, some who have been city employees for nearly 30 years, have been routinely denied opportunities to advance their careers to obtain higher wages. A quick look at the city's employment dashboard reveals this to be true. According to the Demographics dashboard as of January 2022, while white employees made up 48.9% of the total workforce, they disproportionately
Speaker 3: represented 61.6 of employees making over 80,000 a year. Even in departments with large percentages of employees of color, the top earners are predominantly white, such as the Department of Public Works, where black and brown employees make up nearly half of the total of the workforce.
Speaker 3: But only 10% of the top ten earners. We have heard from workers of color who have been tasked with training newer, less experienced, predominantly white employees for positions above them, meaning that they are somehow experienced enough to train management but not experience enough to be management.
Speaker 3: We have also heard from qualified city employees who sought to seek higher levels of employment, only to be passed over for a buddy or a relative of a hiring manager. In hearings, we have asked questions to numerous departments as to why they do not have a more diverse workforce.
Speaker 3: Each time we ask this question. We hear a similar response that the talent just isn't there. After meeting with countless workers of color, each of whom have demonstrated their expertize, their passion and their commitment to the city, it is clear that the talent is there, but we're just not utilizing it.
Speaker 3: This is why we are failing. The Boston Fair. Chance at the Fair Chance Act formally codifies a chief diversity officer position who will work with all city agencies to develop a detailed plan for hiring minority employees, women employees, LGBTQ plus employees and employees with disabilities.
Speaker 3: A detailed plan for promotion of State Employees. A detailed plan for improving work place culture, preventing harassment, intimidation and bullying. And a detailed plan for disseminating this information to covered employees. The Chief Diversity Officer will also take the steps to ensure that opportunities for nepotism or workforce discrimination are eliminated.
Speaker 3: We have the capacity in Boston to create a workforce that is representative of our communities and representative our commitment to economic empowerment. I look forward to this conversation and to strengthening this ordinance alongside my colleagues. You know, I just have to say, in being in deep community with a lot of our city employees, many of which were
Speaker 3: even afraid to speak up, it just goes to show that the volume of importance that this particular conversation has in this moment in time to ensure that we're moving the needle when it comes to ensuring that all people have the opportunity to rise up.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Here. The chair recognizes Councilor Arroyo. Counsel Arroyo, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Gray. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Heath, who summarizes really well. What I'll just add to this is I think it's incredibly, incredibly important that as a city, we ensure that residents are qualified to get employed, are promoted, get
Speaker 0: a fair chance at doing so. And my hope is that these changes help make a fairer and more just process when it. And frankly, a more transparent process when it comes to how we decide and make hires and promotions in the city of Boston.
Speaker 0: And so I look forward to working on this with council, and I'm grateful to councilman here for for our work in this. Thank you. Thank you. Council Royal. Is anyone else looking to speak on this matter? If you are, can you.
Speaker 0: Can you raise your hand? I don't see anyone wishing to speak on this matter. If you would like. If you would like to add your name, would you please raise your hand at this time? Mr. Clarke Can you hear it?
Speaker 0: Councilor Fernandez Anderson, Council LRA. Councilor Murphy Council of Rate and Council Lodging Council where. Council of City Council a block. Please add the chair. I don't see I don't see anyone else's name. Anyone else's hand. Docket 0259 will be referred to the Committee on Government Operations.

Speaker 5: Turning tuning in to today's meeting, something that has been incredibly important. If you're ever since I took office, has become even more critical over the last few months. And that has been our violence. Violent crimes in central and west Long Beach.
Speaker 5: That's been mostly impacting my Washington neighborhood. This is why this is one of my top priorities. And I think that it's critical for our residents to know that we are prioritizing their safety and well-being in our communities where it's most needed.
Speaker 5: I'm excited for the impact that these resources are going to have in addressing the issues that my residents bring to me each day. And I'm so grateful to the staff that have worked and secured this front on behalf of the Washington residents.

Speaker 1: Homekey site at 1725 Long Beach Boulevard into permanent supportive housing District one.
Speaker 6: I councilman's well, actually Stafford Port Police. Okay. Is there a brief staff report on this one?
Speaker 8: Yes. Kelly Collopy will give a brief staff presentation.
Speaker 10: Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. So this funding, really, it's requesting authorization or a resolution to authorize an application from the city of Long Beach to apply for the CDBG Homekey funds. Really, the purpose of doing this is to identify a $5.1 million to be able to support the conversion of the course of the best Western
Speaker 10: , which is our Homekey site at 1725 Long Beach Boulevard. So it would move from a transitional housing as it currently operates to permanent supportive housing. So this is to allow for that application process. The applications do go on a rolling basis.
Speaker 10: So our goal is to get in there early and quickly to make sure we don't lose our opportunity. The funds would go towards the phase conversion of the site, including picture upgrades to each unit, installing kitchenettes, replacing flooring, plumbing, TV and internet connectivity, electrical painting and other sort of upgrades to create the permanent supportive housing opportunities.
Speaker 10: I'm open for.
Speaker 6: Questions. Thank you. Councilman's in the house.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Director Khalid. Before that, homelessness is one of the highest reasons for why many residents reach out to my office. And it is a concern for many of us. Also in the city is heartbreaking to me when our neighbor neighborhoods and when I'm out in the neighborhood and see so many people
Speaker 2: struggling, many with mental health needs and other challenges. Getting unhoused people housed is an immediate need. We need to help people get on their feet again and receive the necessary resources to live healthy, clean, and not have to be sleeping on hard, cold, concrete floors on our street.
Speaker 2: So thank you very much for this. And I'm very supportive of this item.

Speaker 1: As Council President, I moved that Council Bill 1407 series of 2018 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.
Speaker 0: Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. And so now, Councilwoman Sussman, this is the bill I believe that you want to amend. Do you have an amendment ready? And we have our legal and legislative staff ready to make sure that we get the language correct.
Speaker 8: So here goes. You're ready.
Speaker 1: To work.
Speaker 8: I move that the ordinance be changed in section 20 7-1 84 F from large slash phased to large or phased.
Speaker 10: And I would propose that the motion just says that we replace wherever it's large backslash phased development, that we add the or conjunctive rather than just in that subsection so that we can catch all of the of the.
Speaker 8: Yes. Thanks. Well, what she said.
Speaker 0: So to clarify, we have a motion to amend Council Bill 18, Dash 14 zero seven, currently on the floor to change, slash to or in all instances throughout. Is that an appropriate motion on the floor?
Speaker 10: It's large backslash, phased project and we will change it to large or phased project.
Speaker 0: Large backslash to large or. Okay. So that is the motion on the floor, but I don't have a second yet for that.
Speaker 4: Can I comment first?
Speaker 0: We have to get it seconded. No, we got the second. Now we can move on to comments. Councilman Ortega was in the queue first. Councilman Espinosa, is that okay or is the sponsor do you do you want to take the first shot?
Speaker 4: It's technically a forward slash.
Speaker 10: I stand corrected.
Speaker 0: Okay. So let the record show. Forward slash in the amendment.
Speaker 8: I've never felt more. Oh.
Speaker 0: Okay. So are we good? Are we covered? Legal on the amendment on the floor, or do we need to restate it one more time?
Speaker 10: You're.
Speaker 0: You're good. We're good. Okay. Council Zone. Councilman Espinosa. That's all. Councilwoman Ortega, did you have a comment on the amendment?
Speaker 6: I have a question on it. So I'm going to ask staff and then I'm going to ask somebody representing the development team, if it's your interpretation that this doesn't do anything different than the current language that is already that was originally filed.
Speaker 6: So I'd like your opinion and then somebody from the development team.
Speaker 11: So I would say that when we said large forward slash phased project that what we meant was large or phased project, that we see them as the same.
Speaker 6: Okay. Somebody from the development team, if you could either come forward or give us a head nod. Mr. Foster.
Speaker 0: We would concur that that would probably be a consistent reading.
Speaker 6: Thank you.
Speaker 0: I see no other comments. We're going to vote first on the amended and then we'll vote on the bill as amended. Correct? I'm getting everything right, Madam Secretary. All right. So, Madam Secretary, roll call on the amendment.

Speaker 1: Ring Item number 23 Report from Economic Development Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution continuing the Belmont Shore Parking and Business Improvement Area Assessment Levee District three. We will have a staff presentation of this item by Eric Romero.
Speaker 1: Economic Development.
Speaker 0: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the City Council. The Belmont Shore Parking and Business Improvement Area, also known as the Business Improvement District, was established by the City Council in 1983, allowing for the levy an annual of an annual assessment to be paid by businesses located in the district.

Speaker 0: Is that correct? Members, please go and cast your vote.
Speaker 1: Components and. Motion is carried.
"
"Speaker 3: Thank you. You bet. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, are there any other questions on 692 scene? And remember that activity up to next one 712 but called out by councilmembers Ortega and shepherd and I just I'll start with Ortega did you want to call this out or do Councilwoman Shepherd did you want to call it out or did
Speaker 3: you have a question? Questions. Question. Councilwoman Taylor? GRENELL.
Speaker 8: My question is for someone from Public Works. Your final Q. So this bill deals with traffic signals. And what I'm wondering is if it involves removing any traffic signals from locations, because I know in a number of our neighborhoods where we have had lights, they've been removed and replaced with stop signs.
Speaker 8: So is this just for new lights or is it also for removing traffic signal lights in some areas?
Speaker 2: Okay. I'm Michael Pennacchio with Denver Public Works Transportation. This particular grant is for upgrading existing traffic signals, so it's going to upgrade the communications and the backup battery power to the existing traffic signals.
Speaker 8: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Ortega, Councilwoman Shepherd.
Speaker 1: So to go a little bit further with that, I am wondering, does it include any kind of upgrades that might have like pedestrian countdown signals associated with them?
Speaker 2: This again, this grant is more for aimed at communications and battery backup. So most of the equipment that we'll be replacing isn't seen by the general public. It's it's the way that the signal is going to operates, the way that we maintain and operate in.
Speaker 1: You mean how the brain, like the central brain communicates to these?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the computer that controls it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then how how are the. So are you saying that that the brain is getting updated or the individual signals the brain is being updated or the individual signals?
Speaker 2: It's it's the way that it communicates to our central system.
Speaker 1: The individual ones. So how are those chosen? Well, how do you choose which ones to upgrade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have a well, we have the list of all of them that we take to. This is a grant that we apply for. And we received four years worth of grant money to upgrade regionally significant signals. So typically we'll see these programs along like Federal Boulevard along shared in a lot of state facilities, ones that reach
Speaker 2: outside of the extent of Denver.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Shephard. Any other questions on 712? All right. And thank you, Mr. Flynn. Okay. And that's 1786 called out by Councilman Monteiro. What would you like for us to do with this?
Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to call it out for a vote for the purposes of abstaining.
"
"Speaker 1: Next item, please.
Speaker 0: Item 17 Report from Economic and Property Development. Recommendation to execute an agreement with the County of Los Angeles to receive and expand $650,000 in grant funds to operate a youth jobs program citywide.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Richardson.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I just want to is this this the funding that we use for our summer youth, our jobs?
Speaker 9: Again.
Speaker 6: It is a portion of that. So it's an augmentation to the we are funding that you saw in the previous item. Again, it's an annual allocation that's gone on for several years. This is the highest allocation that we've gotten initially in the city of Long Beach, partially based on the performance in the placements that we've we've achieved
Speaker 6: . It does allow us to extend the programing down from our 18 to 20 4 to 214 year olds. And again, it's direct work experience money. And with this money, it actually allows us to put about an additional 310 Long Beach youth to work each summer.
Speaker 4: And and is this some of the funding? We're, you know, forget all that. But this is this is fantastic. And the Summer Youth Hire is that program is a phenomenal violence prevention program, along with the spirit of everything we've talked about tonight.
Speaker 4: I think the fact that you expand on that program, adding 300 additional positions for youth 14 to 24 is outstanding. I know that we've talked and we've set a goal this summer for 150, hiring 150 North Lombard youth over the course of this summer.
Speaker 4: And so I just want to say, keep up the great work. I'm this is a really tremendously important item, and I'm honored to help you again spend this money.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Gonzalez. Councilwoman Gonzalez.
Speaker 2: Yes. Thanks again, Nick. Again, this is also I know it's annual, but we're expanding it to include, you know, four years younger for our youth, which is great. I just did have one question really is whether we can receive, because I'd like to see how this is performing.
Speaker 2: And what do you think would be the best time to find out to get like a two from four back to the council to evaluate the performance.
Speaker 6: So most of most of the work experience will happen before the end of August. There are some participants whose circumstances will change over the course of the summer, and we're able to carry some of this money forward and carry them forward.
Speaker 6: BULK But the bulk of the expenditure and program activity will occur before the end of the summer. So we would be happy to come back to you with with the TFF in September to let you know where, what the placements were by district, what businesses sponsored our youth, how they performed some of the, some of the performance
Speaker 6: reviews that the employers put forward.
Speaker 2: That's great. I know you get excited about numbers just like I do sometimes. So thank you. Appreciate that. That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Council. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 10: Thank you. And I see a note in the staff report that the average youth will get about 125 hours worth of work. I think that's that's significant and certainly falls in line with the summer months. I see here that this goes into effect July 1st, 2016, 18 through June 20, 2017.
Speaker 10: The question is when will we start ramping up to hire these 300 youth? Have they been hired already in anticipation of this?
Speaker 6: I'm sorry. Actually, as of this afternoon, 92% of those slots are already full. So it's we anticipate the annual allocation. Again, there's there's other funding that serves use. There's certainly always other opportunities through through our work with the private sector or the or the foundation community to bring more money then to serve the youth.
Speaker 6: So so we keep this cycle of applications on, on a rolling basis in our work and to have youth eligible and ready to go when they have the the bulk of their schedule open in the summer.
Speaker 10: Well, thank you. This is great news. And I will be supporting this hardly.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Austin. Is there any member of the public that wish to address Council on item 17? Sing None. Members cast your vote.
Speaker 0: Motion carries.

"Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Brian. Any further comments on this legislation saying that those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I those oppose vote no. The motion carries the resolution is adopted. The chair sign it. Please read agenda item number 20 into the record.
Speaker 7: Agenda item 20 Resolution three one 700 Granting conceptual approval to Swedish health services to construct and maintain a pedestrian tunnel under and across Motor Avenue, south of Columbia Street and north of Cherry Street. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 9: Councilmember O'Brien This item is from the same project that we talked about, an item 15. This is resolutions for conceptual approval. So what we do is we say, yes, conceptually this tunnel, the pedestrian tunnel under, under and across minor, we approve.
Speaker 9: They have some work to do to come back and be more specific. And at that point we'd have an ordinance to approve it similar to the other project. They've worked closely with community members on this and the investments they're going to make for public benefit are well supported and I think justify support of this resolution.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Bryan, are there any comments, all those in favor of the resolution vote? I, i those oppose vote no. The motion carries. The resolution is adopted. The chair will sign it. Agenda item number 21.
Speaker 7: Agenda item 21 Resolution 31706 approving the Seattle Freight Master Plan. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.
"
"Speaker 5: Agenda Item 21 Council Bill 120214 An ordinance relating to land use and zoning renaming single family zones two neighborhood residential zones. The committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Strauss, back to you.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President. In September, the city council passed an amendment to the sale, a comprehensive plan to change the name of single family zones to neighborhood residential zones to better reflect the reality of these zones, which already include many backyard cottages, detached houses that are home to multiple families and legacy duplexes and triplexes that pre-date our
Speaker 2: existing zoning laws. The name change was also a long standing request of both the Seattle Planning Commission, as well as the City Council from the mandatory housing affordability process. In September, we adopted that comprehensive plan amendment. The legislation before us today would implement that comprehensive plan amendment by amending the municipal code to effectuate the name change.
Speaker 2: Again, there are no changes to zoning within this bill. We are required to amend the comprehensive plan before we can change the land use code. So just like in September, the legislation does change the underlying. It does change the zoning name.
Speaker 2: It does not change what is allowed to be constructed in that zone. It just changes the name to neighborhood residential. I have to like I have to call out and shout out the leadership. Councilmember Mosqueda. Councilmember Mosqueda has led on this issue before I came to office as well as to Aaron House for her work and outreach
Speaker 2: and Alicia Whitson for his amazing work on all of these land use policies. Nor on my committee director has had an integral role. And thank you to Noah Councilmember Strauss.
Speaker 0: Appreciate it. Colleagues, any additional comments on this council? Bill Agenda Item 21 Council Bill 120214 Councilman Mosquito, please.
Speaker 3: Thank you very much. Council President. Thank you. Chair of Land Use of Members Trials. Thank you for sponsoring this follow up legislation to the legislation we co-sponsored this summer amending the Comprehensive Plan. I am very excited about this follow up.
Speaker 3: I think that, as you said, this will help us lay the ground, make sure that our language and code, as well as in a comprehensive plan, is reflective to the true character of South Africa's. As we embark on the much awaited and deeply engaging comprehensive plan, major updates that will start with community engagement next year and will
Speaker 3: hopefully work to address the exclusionary zoning still embedded in our statute. I really appreciate that the more inclusive, accurate names such as Negative Neighborhood Residential recognizes these neighborhoods are already home to that diversity that you outlined and helps to make sure that folks know how that diversity adds to our thriving neighborhoods across Seattle.
Speaker 3: And the name Single Family Designation solely does not yield the truly diverse nature of what our neighborhoods are as we seek to have robust discussion with community members going forward. I want to also thank Erin House and I know you did a tremendous amount of work.
Speaker 3: And as I mentioned in your committee last week, I want to extend our appreciation as well to our state legislative champions, who have also been embarking on similar efforts at the state level to try to create more inclusive and diverse cities across our state.
Speaker 3: And I want to thank our very own representative to represent Mary Fitzgibbon, Representative Chopp, along with community organizations such as the Housing Development Construction, South Seattle Chamber of Commerce and Sierra Club. 350 Seattle Share the Cities and API a Seattle chapter.
Speaker 3: I think this is a really exciting day. From a purely technical perspective, the term single family has been a misnomer since 1994, when the ADU legislation was passed so long overdue and greatly appreciated. Councilmembers very excited to vote for this.
Speaker 0: You so much. Councilor Mesquita, are there any additional comments on comfortable 120214. Agenda item 21 Hearing None. Will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of Council Bill 120214. Agenda Item 21.

"Speaker 2: Agenda item four Council Bill 120329 An ordinance relating to Seattle Public Utilities Emergency Assistance Program temporarily extending increased assistance related to COVID induced customer delinquencies and amending Section 21.7 6.065 of the Seattle Municipal Court.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I move to pass Council Bill 120329. Is there a second? Second, Councilor Peterson. And this is your bill. The floor is yours.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Council president, colleagues, all three utility bills, utility relief bills here co-sponsoring Councilmember Nelson. This one happens to deal with Seattle Public Utilities specifically. It does the same thing for our emergency assistance program as the city bill we just adopted a moment ago.
Speaker 1: As with its companion bill, this council bill 120329 simply extends an existing utility relief policy. Extending this release through 2023 will become even more important for customers of Seattle Public Utilities, because the King County Executive and King County Council members are currently considering a substantial increase in wastewater treatment fees.
Speaker 1: King County passes their wastewater treatment fees, which comprise nearly 50% of households, as few bills directly to our Seattle customers. So the more relief we can provide to lower income at SPU customers, the better. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Councilor Peterson. And I should have noted that I actually had it noted here in the margins that these are the items two, three and four are Councilmember Peterson and Councilmember Nelson. So thank you. Are there any comments for Councilmember Peterson?
Speaker 0: A cast member must get up.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much. I just want to take this opportunity to thank Councilmember Peterson for the joint work that we are looking into with the public utilities folks about how to make sure that more of the people who are qualifying for the utility discount program get automatically enrolled.
Speaker 2: And that that's something that I had looked into in 2018 and 2019. And I think with the continued efforts to extend additional support, but also the concern on the horizon that many of these supportive programs are going to sunset, having automatic enrollment and things like utility, discount program and other strategies to support working families.
Speaker 2: It's going to be really critical. So I really appreciate you taking the reins on that, Councilmember Peterson, and your quick action to respond to some of those ideas and look forward to continuing to engage with you on some longer term policy solutions.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Casper.
Speaker 0: Hey. We all done.
Speaker 1: You council president asked. Okay, great.
Speaker 0: There you go, Mr. Peterson. No, thank you. So thank you, everybody. So let's move on. Will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill? Councilmember Strauss? Yes. Councilmember Herbold.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Lewis.
Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 0: And I understand that you're going to read five and six into the record. And Kessler ROSQUETA will address five and six together, but we'll vote on them separately. So, Madam Clerk, please read five and six into the record.

"Speaker 0: There's a lot at stake. The numbers from the census help determine federal funding to support services and infrastructure for the people we serve. You'll hear all of us talking more about the census as we get closer to April 1st.
Speaker 0: If you want more information, please visit Denver gov dawg slash census 2020. All right. That concludes the announcements for this evening. There are no presentations, but we do have one communication. Madam Secretary, will you please read our communication?
Speaker 3: 2193 A letter dated February 14th, 2020 from Michael V Hancock Mayor notifying City Council of his veto of Council Bill 20 zero zero 71. Council President Clark and Members of City Council. Over the past several days, I have heard from thousands of residents passionately expressing their opinions on both sides of this issue.
Speaker 3: I want to thank everybody who has shared their views, especially those I have spoken to personally experts in veterinary care, animal care and control, as well as residents of our city who have had experiences with the pit bull breeds, all to gain a broader understanding of what this change would mean for our community and those who own
Speaker 3: these dogs. After deep reflection and consideration, I find that I cannot in good conscience support this legislation and will exercise my authority as mayor to veto it. Let me say at the outset that I salute the sponsor of this ordinance, Councilman Herndon, and his fellow council members who have tried to craft legislation that creates a data and
Speaker 3: licensing system for these breeds that is supported by veterinary experts and encourages owners of pit bull breeds to manage their pets. Unfortunately, less than 20% of all pets in Denver are currently licensed, which raises significant questions about the effectiveness of this proposed new system.
Speaker 3: While much progress has been made in recent years to increase that number, more intentional efforts around responsible pet ownership, dog licensure and registration and off leash dogs are needed before this proposal should be considered. The reality is that irresponsible pet owners continue to be a problem and it is the irresponsible owners and their dogs I must consider
Speaker 3: in evaluating and the overall impact of this ordinance. We cannot diminish the very real, very traumatic experiences of those who have reached out to me to share their stories. Well, I appreciate the effort that Councilman Herndon has put into crafting this ordinance and its guardrails.
Speaker 3: I do not believe this ordinance fully addresses the very real risk to severe injury that can result from attacks from these particular dog breeds, especially should they happen to a child. At the end of the day. I must ask whether passage of this ordinance would make our homes and neighborhoods safer or pose an increased risk risk to
Speaker 3: public safety. I have concluded that it will pose an increased risk. Increased risk. I encourage members of City Council to reconsider their approach to this ordinance, which has been in the municipal code for over three decades. If we were to make this change now and harm comes to someone as a result, then we have done a disservice
Speaker 3: to the people of this great city. Respectfully, Michael B Hancock Mayor.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Secretary. The communication regarding regarding the veto of Council Bill 2271 is received and filed. All right, Councilman Herndon, I understand that in on this issue, you have a motion to override the veto. On Council Bill 2071.
"
"Speaker 2: No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. Councilmember Flynn has called out Bill 21, Dash 1493 for a vote under pending. No items have been called out. Madam Secretary, please put the first item on our screen.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Go ahead with your comments on resolutions 21, Dash 15, 16, 15, 17, 15, 18 and 15, 19, please. Thank you. Madam President, pursuant to Council Rule 3.7, I'm calling these resolutions out to postpone consideration until Monday, January ten.
Speaker 2: Over the last couple of weeks, I've had the opportunity to speak with our Bonn Council for the airport, as well as our legal advisor. And I want to thank Phil Washington, Crystal de Herrera and Mike Shanahan for their help and assistance in getting these meetings set up.
Speaker 2: You all received a copy of the questions that I asked in the answers that they provided in writing. I know some of you still had additional questions, and rather than debating all of that on the floor tonight, I thought it made sense for you all to have the opportunity to get your questions answered between now and next
Speaker 2: Monday so that when we bring it back, hopefully we have the votes to move it forward. I am very comfortable with the financial status of where we are. If you take into account the fact that we made it through a pandemic and never had to dip into our 500 plus days of cash that are on hand, and
Speaker 2: I kept looking for that unanticipated situation that might occur in the future and really feel comfortable that our team has done an amazing job in looking out for the fiscal health of our airport and making sure that we can not only do this, but still have those reserves that are needed to be able to move us forward
Speaker 2: to allow any of the future capital projects to be done, as well as the financing that is going to come forward this year. If you recall, in 2021, we did some interim restructuring of some of our financing and that will come back as permanent financing in 2022.
Speaker 2: So with all of that, we're still able to keep our cost per employment in in the middle of the range compared to all of the other airports and really believe that that's in large part to our consultants and our amazing staff that we have at the airport who constantly are looking out for the financial well-being of our
Speaker 2: airport. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. And as a quick reminder to folks in chambers and the public listening, our Rule 3.7 doesn't require a motion. Any councilmember can make that request of a resolution and pull it off the agenda for one week.
Speaker 2: We're going to go ahead and move on to Councilmember Flynn for comments.
Speaker 7: Thank you, Madam President. I join Councilwoman Ortega in.
Speaker 4: Making that request as well. So thank you, Councilwoman. I have had the benefit of a lot of briefings and information and data.
Speaker 7: And discussion.
Speaker 4: With the DIA team, and I really appreciate it. As I've said before.
Speaker 7: This is a this.
Speaker 4: Has been a difficult and troubled.
Speaker 7: Project. I compared it.
Speaker 4: At committee to we've gone in.
Speaker 7: And we've decided to remodel our kitchen and we find out halfway through, we're making mistakes.
Speaker 4: We need plumbing moved, we need whatever. We can't just stop in the middle. This is a project that needs to be finished and it needs to be finished the right way. It looks like the scope of this project is the right way.
Speaker 4: I want to remind folks who might be watching and folks here in the chambers that this is no longer the great mall project.
Speaker 7: That it was under the P3.
Speaker 4: We're not turning the gypsum terminal into a shopping center, but this is making the airport. The kind of airport we would have designed in the eighties and nineties when we conceived it. If we had known that 19 guys with box cutters were going to change the aviation industry.
Speaker 4: So this rearrangement and relocation of security is something I think this body has spoken pretty clearly needs to be done completely. This phase three would do that. The heartburn that a lot of us are having is simply with the price tag.
Speaker 7: And I just have a few more things that I.
Speaker 4: Need to.
Speaker 7: Understand.
Speaker 4: A little better. I see Mike back there and Crystal, thank you. You'll be hearing from.
Speaker 7: From us during the.
Speaker 4: Week. And so. Thank you, Madam President.
Speaker 7: I look forward to a final vote on this next week.
Speaker 2: All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And as a reminder, Council Resolutions 21, 15, 16, 15, 17, 15, 18 and 15, 19 will be back before Council for consideration on Monday, January ten. Madam Secretary, would you please put the next item on our screen?
Speaker 2: Councilmember Ortega You can go ahead with your questions on item 21, Dash 1523. Thanks, Madam President. This is a contract for our I.T. department. It's basically for our I.T. leadership team providing some technical and professional. It says programs.
"
"Speaker 2: Perfect. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, President Park.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Gilmore. All right. That concludes the questions on this one. Madam Secretary, if you please, put the next item on our screens. And Councilmember CdeBaca, if you want to go ahead with your questions on 44.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President. Is there anybody here to answer questions on this contract? Can you introduce yourself?
Speaker 3: Good evening. I'm John Looper with Department of Housing Stability.
Speaker 5: Awesome. Thank you so much for coming up tonight. Very excited about these dollars for motel vouchers have had some challenges when recommending this option to constituents because we're not really sure who to direct them to and how to know when we've spent down our vouchers.
Speaker 5: And so I'm wondering if in the coming year if there's any new infrastructure electronically that's being built to track our our vouchers in real time? Or how do we as city council representatives know what's left in our voucher bank when we're trying to connect constituents to these emergency services?
Speaker 3: So for as far as like an electronic way of tracking or a voucher bank, we don't really have that set up yet. That's something we could look into in the future. This specific contract is really for the family motel, which is for 30 rooms.
Speaker 3: That's that's kind of it's. It's managed between the Volunteers of America, our office, Department of Housing, Stability, and then Department of Human Services. So Human Services has different outreach workers that write the vouchers to this program. And then Volunteers of America also has a an evening voucher rider that.
Speaker 3: All right. Vouchers to this program also and they work out of Samaritan House every evening.
Speaker 5: So how do we know what our usage is throughout the year?
Speaker 3: So for this this specific contract, it's pretty much 100% use. I think the the occupancy is in the high nineties and they serve about just over a thousand families within a year. There are a couple of other contracted motels and that's kind of as an add need basis as the this family motel fills and they have to
Speaker 3: overflow into other motels that are contract motels.
Speaker 5: So when you say 100% utilized, what does that mean? Does that mean that they're 100% full right now and we have a waiting list or what is that?
Speaker 3: They're in the high nineties for their utilization. So at some nights they're at 100%. And we're we're sending families to contracted motels. The other motels other nights they might be 90% full. And so it just kind of varies night to night.
Speaker 3: Average stay is about ten days. So families there, though, some of them may stay for just a night. Some of them may stay for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the needs of that family.
Speaker 5: And so is there with this specific one, are there preconditions of.
Speaker 2: Service.
Speaker 1: Or.
Speaker 5: How do you how do you qualify to get into.
Speaker 1: This?
Speaker 3: So really, if if a family is homeless in Denver, there could be. A man or woman. As long as they have children and they're homeless in Denver, they just need to connect with the Department of Human Services with their general assistance program Monday through Friday through from, I believe it's eight four.
Speaker 3: And then if they aren't at Denver, Human Services between that timeframe, they would utilize Samaritan House with the voucher riders that are there in the evenings and they'll they'll ask questions. Usually if people are residents of Denver or they're homeless in Denver, they can get multiple nights and then they can meet with a staff member to look
Speaker 3: at some kind of future planning for them if they're from out of state. They're usually always given one night. And then there we figure out what the next steps would be for that family.
Speaker 5: So before we send somebody to the Samaritan House.
Speaker 2: Or Denver Human Services.
Speaker 5: How do we know if we're at the 90% or 100%? Because it's hard to send someone who has very little resources to a Denver Human Services spot during the day knowing that that night there are not going to be any vouchers.
Speaker 5: Who do we contact?
Speaker 3: So that would be during the day. It'd be it would be human services, general assistance. And I don't have that number handy, but just through Human Services, the General Assistance Department, they'll be able to answer that question. It's hard to contact Volunteers of America in the evening to find that out because they're they're seeing people as they're
Speaker 3: coming in. We don't. I think what you're getting at is we don't really have like a like a system that's showing the actual users. They keep track of that on hand as people are coming in. So that's something that could be improved.
Speaker 5: Is there a plan for that?
Speaker 3: I'm not sure. So there's a are the Department of Housing Stability, they're going through a strategic planning process. And part of that's going to be the shelter strategy planning. And so that may be part of that.
Speaker 5: Some it's as simple as Google forms. If the providers could all get on the same page, it would be really helpful for the rest of us trying to be that broker for services. So thank you.
Speaker 3: Okay. You're welcome.

Item 18 report from Health and Human Services recommendation to execute all agreements necessary with the Long Beach Community Foundation to establish and administer the Mayor's Fund to end homelessness. Transfer the balance in the Mayor's Fund. Homelessness Trust to the Long Beach Community Foundation.
Speaker 1: Mayor's Fund to End Homelessness and authorize Health and Human Services Department to receive and expend funds from the Long Beach Community Foundation citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I'll just briefly I'll just just maybe I can get you a brief report in a in a nutshell, I think there's been for decades a mayor's fund for the homelessness. It's existed has not been active and probably it's been active, but it hasn't been proactive, I guess, in the last ten, 15 years or so.
Speaker 0: It collects maybe at any given year between 25000 to $30000 a year through the utility giving program. That's that's there. As part of the long term efforts around homelessness, there's a strong interest to activate the fund. And there has been the staff's recommendation, which I support, is to move the fund to the community foundation.
Speaker 0: They're willing to fundraise, manage the fund, and then maximize their work around homelessness to support that fund. And so I know it's something that that board strongly supports, and they believe they can significantly raise dollars as well as putting in their own matching dollars to work with the city on managing the fund instead of it being operated
Speaker 0: out of the health department. And so, Kelly Cartwright, did I miss anything on that?
Speaker 6: No, I think you've got it.

Speaker 0: Councilman, you Ranga.
Speaker 9: Thank you, Mayor. I represent the seventh District and a river runs through it. I want to thank staff for supporting this.

"Speaker 7: And, you know, when we start talking about equity, not, you know, targeting the same neighborhoods over and over. So these are some things that I want to make sure that we as a council are being brought into that conversation and not be expected to just rubber stamp something at the 11th hour.
Speaker 7: Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 2: And I believe we are coming back to the safety committee at some point in July for an update. So we're working to schedule.
Speaker 7: Great. Thank you so.
Speaker 0: Much. Thank you. Hold on. Just take somebody else. Councilmember Kenny.
Speaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Just a comment. I really appreciate Councilwoman CdeBaca highlighting the need to maintain and sustain the level of service we're providing. We may actually even need to prepare to expand it if people fall into homelessness because of the economic crisis we're facing.
Speaker 6: So even while we successfully house people, we may have more people coming into homelessness. It does not mean that our solution of supportive housing doesn't work. It simply means it's not to scale, to keep pace with the need, particularly in an economic crisis.
Speaker 6: But I do just want to say that for for those who may be watching or listening, who are passionate about maintaining the level of care and emergency shelter that we've been providing, it is critical that you check into the group living zoning process.
Speaker 6: I know I may begin to sound like a broken record, but our zoning code has codified some of the same racism and exclusion that we are talking about in other systems in our city. And there is a proposal that would expand the ability and modernize the ability to provide shelter so that we can not only maintain but
Speaker 6: improve the quality of shelter to provide, for example, 24, seven services versus just overnight sleeping on a mat. Our zoning code right now actually codifies the fact that people can't be in beds in some cases because a shelter might lose its, quote unquote, emergency overflow status.
Speaker 6: Those are some of the back flips our current zoning code requires of providers. So I just want to say that if these issues are important, it is about money. It's about our budget conversation, it's about the safety conversation, but it's also about zoning.
Speaker 6: If our neighborhoods do not include and welcome people of various backgrounds to live in our city, then we will not be able to achieve the goal of making sure that when this shelter closes, people don't end up on the streets.
Speaker 6: So I just wanted to connect issues again that are connected. You can go to Denver Gov Dawgs Group Living to learn more about that change. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. All right, that concludes the comments on this item. Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens and that will be Bill 508. Councilmember CdeBaca, go ahead with your questions on. You're right.
"
"Speaker 0: One nay 11 AIS Resolution 1291 has been adopted. All right, Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens. And Councilman Hines, you had to comment on this one on 1330.
Speaker 4: Yes, Mr. President, go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. And this is a comment in the in the. But the purpose is full transparency. So just for what it's worth, next week, unless I hear good reason. Otherwise, I will propose an amendment to 19 Dash 1330.
Speaker 4: Specifically, I intend to propose a narrow amendment requiring a one hour response time for elevator companies when someone has become trapped in an elevator due to a power or mechanical failure. This is a result of multiple complaints by constituents in districts nine and ten.
Speaker 4: And I did touch base with Councilman CdeBaca in advance to verify that this is the case. And these two districts of the two districts with the most elevators in the city. As we continue to grow, as the city will continue to need additional elevators that function correctly.
Speaker 4: And in case you already know, in case excuse me in case you don't already know, Denver fire reports needing to rescue eight people each day in Denver from trapped elevators. Denver Fire also reports that a common report is that the phones in those elevators that are stuck also do not work.
Speaker 4: Denver excuse me? Denver Airport reports that their minutes contract has a ten minute response time. And and certainly they pay for that response time. But the point is that elevator companies can respond. And, of course, you know, there's a there's a financial component there.
Speaker 4: But but there's a financial component in any maintenance contract, particularly, or as an example, the maintenance contract that that my HRA has with our elevator company is there's a financial component. So Denver Fire reports that this response time is in line with other industries.
Speaker 4: So this is not out of out of purpose. And and just part of the reason why I'm making this public today is because we reached out multiple times to the elevator companies. And after this went through Ludy, we reached out and the response was, quote, Due to vacation and travel schedule, I will not be available until January
Speaker 4: ten. Quote, It is impossible for us to have a dialog with an industry that that cannot be available until after this is passed. So so I'm putting it out here that I'm soliciting input from anyone who thinks that this this amendment is not prudent.
Speaker 4: The last thing I'd say is that I just I won't go back over this because I already mentioned it in Ludie and committee, but I shared several concerns about. Elevators. Elevator maintenance and the relationship between proper elevator maintenance and having to rescue people from broken elevators.
Speaker 4: So if you have any concerns or comments or input about elevators or elevator maintenance or any reason why we should not have a one hour response time in line with every other industry, please reach out to the District ten office.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Since you called this out, I'm just going to quickly say outside of elevators, there is a lot to be excited about in this code, especially when it comes to the environment and how our buildings are built and what kind of energy they use and what kind of emissions they release.
Speaker 0: And in addition to that, for the first time ever in Denver, we will have the Denver Green Code, which gets us even closer to where we need to be to be addressing climate change and meeting the science based standards that have been set forward that we need to be meeting as a city lot to be excited about
Speaker 0: in here, even if we have a few kinks to work out before we get it fully approved. But looking forward to that. All right. Next up, Madam Secretary, I believe we're now on to 1341. And Councilman Ortega, I am correct in remembering that you are the one called out for a vote.

Speaker 5: Cedar Grove Espoo initiated a competitive process for successor services last year. The utility received a competitive proposal in January from Cedar Grove composting and has been negotiating with Pacific Clean and Cedar Grove for successful financial and operational transition.

"
"Speaker 1: The report of the City Council Agenda one clerk 5314415 2019 State of the City address delivered by Mayor Jenny Durkan on February 19th, 2019.
Speaker 0: Just one moment. So this is a just sort of a perfunctory filing of the file, the speech, if you will, and I believe we will vote on it. And we'll place the file on the file before we vote on filing the clerk file.
Speaker 0: But anyone wish to say any words? No regrets council members want.
Speaker 2: Thank you, President Hollande. Just wanted to explain to members of the public that the vote the council is about to take will file into the city's records, the mayor's State of the City address. And of course, it should be on record.
Speaker 2: So I will be voting yes, but my vote will not be a vote on the content of the speech. However, and I wanted to bring to light something that the mayor said that was, in my view, dangerously inaccurate.
Speaker 2: Three times in his speech, Mayor Durkan said that Seattle has invested over $710 million in affordable housing during her time in office, adding, however, compare that while the claim to what it actually says in her budget, in the mayor's budget, it lists the funds that she has made available to build affordable housing.
Speaker 2: It is, and this can be verified by council members. It is less than $50 million per year, not 710 million. And as a matter of fact, if the political establishment was actually willing to spend $710 million on building affordable housing instead of under 50 million, then we could actually begin to seriously address the affordable housing crisis.
Speaker 2: The problem is that when the mayor exaggerates the investment in affordable housing, it sounds like it is not necessary to tax big business to build affordable housing on a scale big enough to have a real impact. But that would be wrong.
Speaker 2: In reality, the mayor is not investing 710 million. Really. She is investing less than 1% of the city budget in affordable housing. And regular people will need to continue to get organized to build a movement, to build anything close to affordable housing worth $710 million.
Speaker 2: And let's remember that ordinary people in New York City just won a massive victory against Amazon in its attempt to get a $3 billion corporate handout, including a helipad for Jeff Bezos. It really shows that when people get organized, we can win.
Speaker 2: This was assumed to be a done deal by everybody, including business owners, who were surprised by the fact that Amazon had to back off. So I will be voting yes on filing this Clark file, but I do not endorse her false claim about investment in affordable housing.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you for those words, Councilmember. What would anyone else like to say anything before we file the Clark file? And for the viewing public, this is a public document. The facts are, I believe that Councilmember Swan was referring to our Page seven of the published document and I personally wanted to thank the Mayor for giving a speech
Speaker 0: and creating a vision for what this city could be. Okay, I'll move to file Clark. File 314415. Those in favor of filing the Clark. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries no place. The file is placed on file.

"Speaker 2: The Report of the Human Services and Public Health Committee. Agenda Item two Resolution 317 39 expressing the city's close commitment to being a more age friendly city under the criteria established by the World Health Organization and the AARP, Network of Age Friendly Communities Committee recommends that the full council adopt the resolution as amended.
Speaker 4: Good. Thank you very much for reading that into the record. I want to say thank you to my colleagues for supporting this and supporting me in this work. The age friendly designation for the city of Seattle happened at the end of August, just of 2016, and our mayor had worked with AARP and the World Health Organization so
Speaker 4: Seattle could be designated an age friendly city. Between that point and now, I will say that not as much has been accomplished as I would like to see. But fortunately, we now have an action plan and this resolution has been drafted.
Speaker 4: And the mayor just last week announced within the departments what the various departments are going to do. But I do want to acknowledge and say special thanks to Steve Lee from the mayor's office and Catherine Lester from the Human Services Department and our own Lily Ramon, who is now, as of last Saturday, Lily Rau, for the good
Speaker 4: work that they have done on that to generate these really age friendly goals and success measures. What I'm focused on is department by department, but I'd like to start with Seattle Department of Transportation. I would like to see us really implement an institute across our city, a new sidewalk program, and I should say sidewalk programs, plural.
Speaker 4: We can learn from other cities, but small things such as maintaining our sidewalks across the city, making a network that connects, having longer walk signals for safe crossing where appropriate, not just for seniors, people with strollers, kids who are learning to ride a scooter, which I mentioned earlier before, or people with disabilities.
Speaker 4: We really need to be conscious across our city that all of us are going to get there one time or another, so we might as well get going on it right away. So there are eight domains in the World Health Organization's criteria for livability, and it includes affordable housing, better transportation, better connections for neighbors with people who
Speaker 4: are aging and encouraging different ways for people to live. And that includes our auxiliary dwelling or accessory dwelling units. There are many, many things we can do, but as we're thinking about how do we make this a city where we are using a race and social justice lens?
Speaker 4: I really want us to include the lens for people who are aging. I think we can do a great thing, a great number of things with a small number of small costs, but make it a dramatic difference for our city.
Speaker 4: So I know that all of you have heard me say age friendly probably a thousand times in the last four months. But I say thank you, thank you for supporting this resolution. There's a lot we can do and I look forward to doing it with you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Customer Show.
Speaker 1: Now.
Speaker 0: I was led to believe there could be an amendment she would be proposing by substituting versions three for two. Is that so?
Speaker 4: Thank you very much. These were provisions that Councilmember Harold Harrell I'm sorry, Councilmember Herbold recommended. And they really do focus on unemployed workers. That provides additional occupational training for people who are over 65 and also recognizing that people who are over 65 are either staying in or sometimes rejoining the labor force for whatever reasons that are in
Speaker 4: their individual lives. So I support Councilmember. Her Bolts recommendations, and they're in two warehouses on page three of the resolution that's in front of us.
Speaker 0: So you moved to substitute version three for version two? Is there a second? All those in favor of substituting version three for version two a please say I. I oppose the ayes have it. So we have a amended resolution.
Speaker 0: Are you. Would you like to see any more words? Better?
Speaker 4: You know, I think we're I think we're good. I said what I had to say, but I did want to recognize that Alan Lee on central staff has also been very helpful and moving things quickly and responding to the number of amendments that have been coming in.
Speaker 4: So this started off about two months ago, and I think that we've made some real progress on it. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any further comments? All those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended? Vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries and the minute resolution is adopted, the chair will sign it. All right.

Speaker 8: No, that's a councilman fight.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President. I had thought a long time because I wanted to make comments about the settlement, but the settlement is not truly before us today. That's going to be coming up next week in the form of a resolution.
Speaker 5: Whether money sits in the contingency fund according to this supplemental or whether it sits in a claims fund is still sitting until we've decided to spend it. And so the fact that there may not be comments coming does not mean that there is unanimity in feeling on the council.

"
"Speaker 1: Log in number 026 to Council of Florida for the following order for a hearing to discuss offering property tax abatements to property owners in the Newmarket area.
Speaker 0: The chair recognizes counsel. Clarity. Counsel, clarity. You of the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. As everybody on this body knows, particularly the district councils that have been covering this, the residents and business owners in the Newmarket and Mass and Cass area have experienced deteriorating and at times horrific conditions over the last several years.
Speaker 0: That includes decline in public safety, decline of public health, overall cleanliness in general, a decrease in their quality of life that are not necessarily reflected in property valuations in this area. As an at large councilor, I've done numerous walkthroughs with residents and business owners and advocates, along with neighborhood groups, city department leaders.
Speaker 0: And despite those efforts to increase city services and to better coordinate efforts across departments to meet the increased need in the area, and that includes expedited needle cleanup, sidewalk cleaning, mental health outreach and street workers, etc. We've still fallen short on our standards.
Speaker 0: So much so that the new market businesses have created a new market bid and are going around collecting fees from their members to finance supplemental services above and beyond what the city has been providing property taxes as folks now make up nearly 75% of our revenues.
Speaker 0: So again, suggesting an abatement for property taxes is not something that I take that I do serve lightly as a fiscal steward of the city. That said, I think this is a very unique and special case, and I feel that in recognition of our shortcomings, to provide an adequate level of city services to to the homeowners and
Speaker 0: to the business owners in the area, that we should explore the idea of offering a property tax abatement. Generally speaking, the driving idea behind this seeming order is the notion that taxpayers do deserve a high level of basic city services.
Speaker 0: And to some degree, I think we've dropped the ball here. And so looking forward to an expedited hearing, bring in the stakeholders. Let's talk about what area it would encompass and whether or not it makes sense for the city to offer them something even while the bid is ramping up.
Speaker 0: Maybe that's something that we can offer them. In addition to, we're going to be going at those businesses to to increase their contribution and or to make payments to the bid. And maybe we can offer them something in the short term that takes a little bit of a bite out of getting the bid going strong.
Speaker 0: And again, I know that there are folks here, our colleague Russell Baker is done, a lot of great work done. So Flynn on the bid not working with those folks. So this would be, I guess, a complement to that that if we can provide an abatement to to the residents, the homeowners business owners over there, you know
Speaker 0: , it may take a little bit out of their feeling that we, the city, have abandoned them over the last few years. As conditions continue to deteriorate in the area, they look forward again and feel free to hear some comments and welcome folks to sign on.
Speaker 0: Thank you, counsel. Clarity. Would any other counsel like to speak on this issue? If you do, can you please raise your hand? I see. Counsel Arroyo, the chair recognizes Counsel Arroyo. You have the floor. Thank you. President Flynn, I just have a question for the chairman.
Speaker 0: Would this apply to the residential folks in the area as well for some of the same similar reasoning? Or is this just for the business folks? And why the distinction or difference? Great. Thank you for the question. As referenced in my comments, the focus will be on the homeowners, the residents that are there.
Speaker 0: That's sort of priority number one, the residents and then obviously the businesses, both of them combined equally. And I've done the walk, as I'm sure you have, as well as our other colleagues up and down all those neighborhood streets and listening to the talk about having to clean out the needles and having their cars broken into and
Speaker 0: having people urinating and defecating and literally having sex out front of their house in their window, all of it trash, graffiti. And they continue to call us. They continue to reach out to the city, to public works, to everyone that would listen.
Speaker 0: And again, they felt that it fell on deaf ears, just given the complexity of the situation and all the issues that were involved with it and trying to deal with it in a in a in both balancing sort of the public safety and the public health needs.
Speaker 0: And sometimes they were on the same page, sometimes they weren't. So the the homeowners, the residents and some of them some of the city's highest taxpayers are in are in some of these properties. So. So, yes, the question is there will be for both.
Speaker 0: Thank you for that clarification. Please add my name. President. Yeah. Please said council Moreno's name. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter before we go to talk to others? Council braided. Your hand is raised. Beg your.
Speaker 3: Pardon? Of my omission. I forgot to Norman's. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Okay. Okay. Consulate. Edwards, you have your hand raised. Okay. If. If you would like to add your name, please, please raise your hand. Please add. Councilor Murphy, Councilor Baker, Councilor Wirral, council me here. Councilor Edwards. Councilor Fernandez Andersson.

"Speaker 6: Agenda Item 23 Council Bill 119866 An ordinance relating to Seattle Public Utilities creating a restricted cash account for depositing donations and gifts authorizing the general manager, CEO of Seattle Public Utilities to accept donations and gifts into the account for the purpose of providing financial assistance to its low income customers.
Speaker 6: The committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Peterson, as chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to address this item.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Council President. So I'm pleased to present and support this bill from Seattle Public Utilities to set up a donation account. This is similar to the one that Seattle satellite has so they can accept donations to help their low income customers pay their bills.
Speaker 3: And this is Council Bill 119866, which was approved by a committee.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Peterson. Are there any comments on the bill? Hearing? None. Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill for both?

"Speaker 7: Agenda Item 40 Council Bill 118486 relating to Seattle Public Utilities declaring certain real property rights relating to a sewer facility easement. Within a portion of property located at 14027 Lake City, way northeast, as being surplus to the city's utility needs.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw.
Speaker 1: Thank you. This legislation authorizes Seattle Public Utilities to relinquish rights to an existing easement at the Bella Largo Apartments in Lake City neighborhood and then turns around and authorizes the director to accept a new easement that will be granted from the owner of these apartments.
Speaker 1: Lake City Investors for a city owned sanitary sewer facility. The property owner will use and develop a new mixed use building for both residential and retail use. The new building will require a larger sanitary sewer connection than the one that currently exists.
Speaker 1: Hence the reason that we're providing a new easement and the agreement meets the needs of both parties and the legislation passed unanimously out of the committee. And we ask for your support.
Speaker 2: Thank you. And questions or comments. Please call the roll on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 3: Harold Licata. I O'Brien. Okamoto, I Rasmussen. I so want Bagshot Garden. I am President Burgess High nine in favor.

And if a majority protest does not exist, adopt a resolution approving the engineer's report and ordering the levy of the VCP benefit assessment.
Speaker 2: Or if a majority protest does exist, the City Council cannot take action on the resolution citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I'll go ahead. I know that the city staff had asked, wanted to see if the if people wanted to form a better control district, had asked the community if they were interested in it. They are not interested.
Speaker 0: They don't want to form a vector control district. And so we won't be forming one. And that's and that's okay. So I don't know if you want to. Go ahead. Madam Clerk.
Speaker 2: The results of the ballot tabulations show that the total percentage of yes ballots weighted by assessment was 45.76%. The total percentage of no ballots weighted by assessment was 54.24%. There is a majority protest.
Speaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Any public comment on this CNN district to receive and file? District three.

"Speaker 0: Ten Eyes. Council Resolutions 21, 15, 16, 21, 15, 17, 21, 15, 18 and 21. 15, 19 have been adopted. Madam Secretary, please put the next item up for us. Councilmember Hines, go ahead with your comments on Council Resolutions 22, dash 0005.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Council president. This is a talking about the Broadway protected bike lane. I just. I know this is in my district. This is not in my district. I want to thank Councilmember Clark for for allowing me to call this out when I guess I have the purview to call it.
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I did want to to talk in favor of of this contract. I as as people know, I believe we all deserve the freedom to get from A to B safely, no matter how we choose to get there.
Speaker 1: And I'm excited that this early protected bike lane will soon receive permanent treatment. I know that Denver and Dottie specifically are working hard to install bike lanes quickly, and they're using a paint and post method that allows us to do that rapid implementation.
Speaker 1: It also allows us to test bike lane implementations before significant infrastructure infrastructure investment is wasted. In other words, we're making sure we get the curves and angles right. But the best protected bike lane has more permanent infrastructure in place, so it's creates stronger barriers between bikes and cars.
Speaker 1: It's better looking infrastructure that fits in with the look and feel of concrete curbs, concrete medians, etc., and fits better in our neighborhoods as well. It helps. It also helps cyclists feel safe that cars won't sneak into the bike lane, which they haven't, which happens all the time, or delivery vehicles or city vehicles or people dropping off
Speaker 1: passengers. Happens all the time. So finally, I recognize that the best infrastructure goes from people from where people are to where they want to go. So I think it's important that the Broadway protected bike lane continue north from the border of Lucky District seven into District ten.
Speaker 1: What might be called a perfect implementation is if it were to continue all the way through District ten northern border. Thank you. Council President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Hines. All right. That concludes the items to be called out this evening. We're going to go ahead and move on to our block vote. All bills for introduction are ordered published. Council members remember this is a consent or a block vote and you will need to vote I.
Speaker 0: Otherwise, this is your last chance to call out an item for a separate vote. Councilmember CdeBaca, will you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor?
Speaker 3: Yes, I move that resolutions be adopted and bills on final consideration be placed upon final consideration, and do pass in a block for the following items. 2114 5721 1501 2115 4722 1422 522 622 722 822 922 1021 1508 2115 3721 1539 2120 2116 one 1503.

Speaker 9: Yeah, I move that council bill 20 20504 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.
Speaker 0: Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. Questions or comments from members of Council Councilmember CdeBaca.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. Can you clarify what this is for real quick before I make my comment?
Speaker 0: I'm sorry. Who are you directing your question to?
Speaker 4: To you.
Speaker 0: You called out.
Speaker 4: It's the special revenue.
Speaker 0: So this is part of our.
Speaker 5: This is our.
Speaker 4: Furlough.
Speaker 0: No, this is not. This is part of your budget. Anything you didn't spend last year, if we don't vote on this, it goes into the general fund. This puts it back in your office budget for this year.
Speaker 4: Okay. And so does this have any connection to the dollars that we were supposed to sequester? Will we have to sequester this once we get it back?
Speaker 0: No, this is moving in. Councilmember Gilmore has our budget and she's flagging me as I'm going to. We'll let her answer that in case.
Speaker 7: Thank you, President Clark. Councilwoman CdeBaca, this transfer is a portion of the special revenue fund that was allocated for the 4% sequester from the central office. And then it's a portion of Councilwoman Torres, my office, Councilwoman Sandoval's office.
Speaker 7: The 4% that city council was sequestering was $7,979. And so this is a portion of some of those offices using their special revenue fund to use that for the 4% sequester. So like your office isn't included in this because I believe your office well, you aren't participating, but so the other offices there may be taking that 4%
Speaker 7: out of their services and supplies. And so we won't see that come forward.
Speaker 4: Awesome. Thank you very much. I wanted to clarify that because as you all are looking at your budgets, take a look at what city council budget is for us to operate 13 offices. There's a reason why some of you don't get callbacks or responses on email, and it's because our executive branch of government keeps our branch of
Speaker 4: government. That's supposed to be the check and balance starved so that we can't respond, so that we can't do these things. And so we were asked by the administration, even though we're not required to furlough, we were asked to furlough and to set aside budget cuts.
Speaker 4: And this is part of what some of those offices had decided to give or not give up. I chose not to because our office receives the highest volume of everything that happens in this city, and we need more staff than we currently have.
Speaker 4: We don't need to be cut. And so I wanted to explain that to you all and make sure that you understand that balance. Government requires balanced budgets and independently elected branches of government should have can measure its size budgets.
Speaker 4: So pay attention to that as you guys are scanning this information because it's critical. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. And I apologize. Thank you, Councilmember Gilmore, for stepping in there, Councilman Hines.
Speaker 8: But thank you, Mr. President. Just to echo Councilmember CdeBaca point, the woman in the front to the BlackLivesMatter shirt, I'm sorry that I did not respond to you. There is me, one person who is sick and one person who took voluntary furloughs this past week.
Speaker 8: And so and that's it. That's that's all we got. So just to councilmember said about this point, we are we are very lean and we try to do as much as we can with what we have. But but we are very lean.
Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. All right. Madam Secretary, roll call on 504.

"
"Speaker 1: So that's that's a pretty important parcel. So congratulations to everybody as part of that. Next up is in District eight, the final parcel tonight, 22.
Speaker 0: Item 22 is a report from Economic and Property Development and Development Services. Recommendation two Adopt specification for the purchase and development opportunity at 5550 100 Long Beach Boulevard. Declare the city on subject property as surplus and authorize city manager to execute all necessary documents with city ventures for the sale of the subject property in the amount of
Speaker 0: 2.5 million. District eight.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Staff Report.
Speaker 8: Michael Conway.
Speaker 7: Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council. The property located at 5100 Long Beach Boulevard at the northwest corner of East Home Street and Long Beach Boulevard is a vacant lot, containing 75,376 square feet, which is slightly over 1.7 acres in size.
Speaker 7: The property was categorized as future development long range property management plan, which properties are disposed through a request for proposal process. The city received three proposals submitted in response to the RFP and a review panel analyzed the three proposals from the perspective of best value for the city.
Speaker 7: The three proposals were somewhat similar in that they all proposed residential development. However, the density ranged from six density units per acre to 86 density units per acre. The submittals included single family homes for sale, townhomes for sale and workforce housing for for rent.
Speaker 7: One proposal did not offer a purchase price, although their sources and uses table indicated the land had a contribution value of $3 million. Of the three proposals, City Ventures LLC was unanimously selected by the review panel as offering the best value to the city.
Speaker 7: City Ventures offered the apparent highest price for the property and offered a medium density project that has a good likelihood of being supported by the adjoining single family residence and the nearby residential community. City Ventures development timeline is proposed to be 90 days for due diligence, an additional nine months for entitlement and closing 30 days thereafter.
Speaker 7: Construction is anticipated to take 18 months. Staff request some flexibility in the due diligence and entitlement time frame if unforeseen events occur that delayed the proposed timeline and with that staff request City Council adopt specifications number RFP PEP 16 Dash 001 for the purchase and development of 5100 Long Beach Boulevard.
Speaker 7: Declare the property surplus authorized city manager. Execute all documents necessary for the sale of the property to City Ventures, LLC for 2.5 million.
Speaker 8: And accept categorical.
Speaker 7: Exemption. S.E. 16 DASH 129. This concludes my report.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Braxton.
Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Mr. Conway and the entire staff for their work in helping to move this project along. I want to congratulate the City Ventures team for winning a competitive bid. There were two other proposals that they beat out for this this project, 42 market rate, condominium units.
Speaker 7: I think it's reasonable density and ample parking along a transit corridor. This is the project that we we're actually would love to see happen along Long Beach Boulevard. It's going to be a great addition and a dramatic improvement along the Long Beach Boulevard corridor.
Speaker 7: It will really upgrade our Virginia Village area. I did have a couple of just really quick questions. I know that particular property has two existing residential properties. I'm just almost connected to it. What do you foresee happening with those properties?
Speaker 7: The the privately owned properties, I am assuming are going to remain in place and exist and continue.
Speaker 8: To exist as residential properties.
Speaker 7: The idea of this lower density was to ensure that the transition from this property to the single family residence nearby and to the residential.
Speaker 8: Community across.
Speaker 7: The street, was intended to be a more of a soft inner integration rather than something a little bit more intense. So we think this will be an appropriate project and indeed the staff report and the plans. Is there a way to to augment this for mixed use?
Speaker 7: Should the developer decide to go down that route? We can certainly explore that through the entitlement process. Okay. Thank you very much. Members, I ask for your your support on this.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Richardson.
Speaker 11: I'll just jump in and congratulate City Ventures, congratulate Councilman Austin and city staff on on making this happen. I know this lot because I live on Long Beach Boulevard, just over the river. That's right next to where I go to the pharmacy.
Speaker 11: So this is this is pretty exciting for for that particular neighborhood. So congratulations to all look forward to that timeline.
Speaker 1: Any public comment on this item? Okay. CNN will take it back here, then again. Again, another great parcel. It's great to see the work being done. Councilman, congratulations. And please cast your votes.
Speaker 0: Motion carries.
Speaker 1: Okay. That concludes the three the three items. I understand that the next next few meetings, there's going to be items like this consistently. So and that's a good thing. I think that'll be that'll be good across the city.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to our homeless items, which we thought we were going to be earlier. I apologize. So let's start. There's two of them. The first one, I believe, is item number 14. Is that right? Yes. Okay. Item 14.
"
"Speaker 4: Agenda Item 23 Resolution 31980. Granting conceptual approval to construct, install, maintain and operate below grade private utility lines. Committee recommended the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much. Casmir Peterson. You are recognized in order to provide the committee report.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Council President Resolution 31980. This resolution is a preliminary approval for development of a heat capturing project that needs a permit to locate pipes under city government streets. The project is in an environmentally beneficial way to capture, for use, heat from sewer lines that would otherwise be wasted.
Speaker 3: We'll see this project again with complete drawings, along with a permit application later. The committee unanimously recommended approval.

"
"Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Great. And the second item is out of nine. Councilman Gonzales.
Speaker 9: So relative to the former discussion, this would be basically amending the municipal code to allow a gym parklet in front of Groundwork Fitness. And so I want to thank goodness I told her not to come. But Jill Ferraro, who has been very diligent in working with my office, I also want to thank the city attorney's office, Charlie
Speaker 9: and Linda Vu, as well as Shaun Crombie and Public Works. I know we gave you all a headache over these parklets and I know it was a lot to navigate with us, but we appreciate it and now we will hopefully have a nice new gym parklet in front of her space.
Speaker 9: So we're excited about that.
Speaker 0: I'll be working out and not really get a motion in a second, please. Why don't we let Councilman Gonzalez the real. Is there any public comment on this signal to scatter votes?
"
"Speaker 7: The Report of the Public Safety, Civil Rights and Technology Committee. Agenda item number one, resolution 31578. Reaffirming the City of Seattle support of Somali communities to continue remittances to Somalia and the Horn of Africa. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell. Thank you very much, council president. So this resolution is addressing a very serious concern in the Somali community, in the Horn of Africa community, relative to the remittance policy. I think many of you are following the issue that when the Merchants Bank of California closed down the accounts of all Somali-American money transfer operations
Speaker 0: in 2015. This has been devastating to the community, Somali community, trying to send money down to their families. And you've seen in the last several years of this cracking down, if you will, and it has devastated many communities and in particular, our local community as well.
Speaker 0: And so this is an attempt to address the seriousness of the issue and to really think about how the city can work with the Somali community to come up with policies, processes, advocacy strategies, solutions that will help the Somali community address this and also, in that process address many of the issues, such as access to capital and
Speaker 0: access to credit as well that would help local communities. So again, I want to thank the executive for reaching out and convening several meetings and I think council members so want a Liccardo O'Brien and others for being deeply involved in the community, trying to work with community members, help us move forward, finding solutions.
Speaker 0: So this resolution states our commitments and I look forward to the ongoing work as we address to Somali remains issue should pass out of committee with full vote and I ask for your support and are you going to move a substitute and I am going to do something that the clerk asked me to do, which is I
Speaker 0: move to amend Resolution 31578 by substituting version for perversion three. And as I move that, there was just some semantic, some semantic issues raised by the law department, but I don't think a change of substance at all. Also I'll second the motion.
Speaker 0: It's been moved that we substitute version four for version three. Are there any questions or discussion on the substitution? All in favor of approving the motion vote. I oppose vote no. So we now have version four in front of us.
Speaker 0: Any questions or comments? Councilmember Swan.
Speaker 5: Thank you. President Burgess Just to add to the comments by Councilmember Harrell, this is a very important resolution. While the City Council does not have any legal jurisdiction over the banks that we are talking about. It does help to put pressure on the federal government, which is, you know, this this the the language of the resolution is
Speaker 5: really geared towards that. And I want to mention that we following Minneapolis as a city that also has passed a similar resolution, I thanked Eisenberg for bringing this forward and for also for being open to the amendments to be brought forward on the suggestion of community activists.
Speaker 5: And above all, thanks to the community activists, we have two of them here, the Abdullah and Hassan, these thank you for your involvement. And clearly, of course, we have a lot of work to do for the welfare of the community, but this was definitely a big part of that.
Speaker 0: Thank you. All in favor of adopting version four of resolution 31578. Indicate by voting. I oppose vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted and the chair will sign it. The report of the Finance and Culture Committee. Please read item two.

Speaker 6: They include amendments to the two provisions around prohibitions around the use of sky lanterns. Open flames and used by fire performers, repair garage sprinklers, signage for commercial cooking appliances, fire department connection signs and tire storage.

I think folks are generally familiar with the Rivers Fish Bar down on the waterfront from related sites, some of the property outdoors there, specifically the areas where a lot of us feed French fries to seagulls is actually public right away and the previous term permit has expired.
Speaker 4: And so this would create a new term permit for ten years that could be renewed for 2 to 10 year extensions beyond that for a total of 30 years. Similar to other permits, this has gone through the process of evaluating the cost of that and the city will be compensated for the lease terms of that.

Speaker 1: So can we the the the item please.
Speaker 2: Report from city clerk recommendation to receive and file the certification of the petition regarding the regulation of medical marijuana businesses and approve one of the following three alternative actions adopt the initiative ordinance without alteration to submit the initiative ordinance without alteration to the voters to be held on November 8th, 2016 or three.

Speaker 0: Thank you. And Mr. City Attorney, I'd like to add to the motion to prepare an analysis that comes back to this council.

Speaker 0: It's it's items two and three from the three options to. To approve receipt of. The clerk certification and then to ask for a report.
Speaker 1: Yep. Okay. There's a motion in a second. So it's to approve the ballot, the ballot measure that the caucus sent over, but also concurrently to ask for a report that would come back to the council.
Speaker 0: Yes.
Speaker 7: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's a motion and a second. Ah. Any public comment on this? We'd love to take the vote expeditiously. Mr. Goodhue.
Speaker 12: If it's all possible, I would suggest. Taking whatever steps necessary and figuring out what the cost would be to oppose any actions. And that would end with that would result in having marijuana legalized within this city. If we're prepared to spend $90 million, urinate away $90 million on a city hall, we can certainly afford the millions to
Speaker 12: fight this off in court. To forestall what the police department has counseled against the consequences of having legalized marijuana here in this city if we think we had problems here tonight. The day would pale in comparison to what we'll have if marijuana is legalized in this city.
Speaker 12: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Any other public comment? We want to take a vote. Quickly, please.
Speaker 4: Just real quick. Although I would have preferred number one, I know there's no consensus or probably won't be.

Speaker 2: Larry GOODHEW Clarke as he addressed the four related items here. And I'm certainly not going to speak on each one of them, but I would take I want to take 3 minutes, but just and combine it all. But I do want to take if you'll allow me about 40 seconds to follow up and a relative to that
Speaker 2: great deal, the the the newest millionaire. And there's something very sweet about it. Remember, the guys came to they came to this country with $0 and were really poverty. They were living on food stamps. The mother had severe cancer and so forth.
Speaker 2: Fast forward to today that they signed it. Zuckerberg had the guy over to his house for lunch and they had been working on the deal for a few months into that, running up for that. They decided to sign the deal and they picked up the phone and they called their respective legal teams and said, meet us over
Speaker 2: here, will sign the paperwork. And the guy said, Listen, I've got a better place to sign that. And Zuckerberg said, Fine, here we go. They hopped in the car, went about 20, 20 minutes, 20 miles away, and it was a vacant building.
Speaker 2: And that was the only obstacle.
Speaker 3: Is there any relevance to.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's just a sweet thing to keep in mind. All of the vacant buildings, the Social Security office where he used to get food stamps and like Martin Luther King, he took the contract that that sealed the deal, signed it to the grill and the door and signed it.
Speaker 2: So that it's just a sweet thing on this. I'm going to make this suggestion. If the city clerk and the city attorney can fashion what I'm about to say into something that is acceptable. Now I know the state the city declares a state of emergency many times.
Speaker 2: I'm going to suggest that the city, this council. After listening to the city fashioning and having the city attorney examine it together with the clerk. Declare a state of emergency. Postpone. The election for one year, during which time the city will hire a retired US federal judge.
Speaker 2: Obviously not from the ninth Circuit. To help bring this, we put the city back on a sound footing. And a year from now. Go back to the public. And that's based upon the fact that every day I hear from more and more people and.
Speaker 2: Both sides of the aisle. The overwhelming sentiment is the two choices we have in terms of the mayoral election, and that's all I'm talking about, the mayoral election. The two choices are simply putrid, period. And I find it astonishing.
Speaker 2: That within what was once a great city, we can't find two people again.
Speaker 0: Regardless of what side of the aisle we got.
Speaker 3: It was a good year. Time's expired. Thank you. I think we know your sentiments on this.

Speaker 3: Next item. 26 is a.
"
"Speaker 5: Agenda item 13. Resolution 31632. Related to the city's emergency management program and many the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Base Plan, Emergency Operations Plan and All Hazards Mitigation Plan as required by Seattle Municipal Code Section 10.0 2.050 hour S.W. 38.5 2.077 and WAC 118-30060.
Speaker 5: The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell. Okay. We go from busy day today.
Speaker 3: For Comcast to civil rights to emergency management. Yeah. Okay. So the City of Seattle's Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan simply is basically a suite of plans together that define our our strategies and our doctrine on how the city will prevent and prepare for and mitigate the impacts from disasters.
Speaker 3: This particular legislation is is necessary to meet our municipal code that requires that a comprehensive emergency management plan is kept current and that under the direction of the mayor promote proposed amendments. They are to be presented to the City Council for review and approval.
Speaker 3: So this local scene is required by state and has been negotiated and plan. And I'm very proud that we have one of the best experts, Barbara Graf, in running our emergency preparedness programs here at the city. There have been significant updates to the several plans, and we went over this in committee and there's a sort of a
Speaker 3: reorganization process that is consistent with state law. All of them are recommended by Ms.. Graff. And on December 2nd, the Public Safety, Civil Rights and Technology Committee recommended passage of this resolution.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? All in favor of adopting resolution 3163 to vote I. I opposed vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted in the chair will sign it. Please, please read items 14 and 15 and 16.
"
"Speaker 0: Thank you. This is mine. So I will go ahead and first move. I will move to pass Council Bill 120286. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill as a sponsor of this bill.
Speaker 0: I will address this item. Council Bill 120286 is legislation that would authorize several actions related to our two new city holidays. As a reminder, December and December 2021, the city enacted two ordinances relating to two new holidays ordinance 126505 Establish Juneteenth as a legal holiday for non represented city employees and a parking holiday for the public.
Speaker 0: Ordinance number 126516 Establish Juneteenth An Indigenous People's Day as legal holidays for city employees represented by the Coalition of City Unions. Although the city has already established Indigenous People's Day as a day of observance, observance and legal holiday for city employees represented by the Coalition, legislation is required to expand this holiday to non represented city employees and
Speaker 0: establish a parking holiday. The proposed legislation would authorize the following actions. Number one, establish Indigenous People's Day as a legal holiday for city employees on the second Monday of October. Number two, establish indigenous people's day as a parking holiday.
Speaker 0: Number three, approve a memorandum of understanding with three unions to establish Juneteenth, an indigenous peoples day as a new paid holiday. And four make technical updates to facilitate observance of Indigenous Peoples Day. Direct costs would include additional pay for minimum staffing requirements and the loss of on street parking revenue for the parking holiday for each car for
Speaker 0: up to about 132,000 for each parking holiday. Completing the establishment of Indigenous People's Day as a new holiday will demonstrate the city's commitment to honoring the culture and contributions of indigenous people. The establishment of both Juneteenth and the Indigenous Peoples Day will also signal a commitment towards achieving racial equity, working towards an anti-racist future, and ending the
Speaker 0: historical and continued harms towards black Americans and indigenous peoples in this region and the United States. For next steps after Council approves the bill today, the executive will transmit and the executive will later transmit separate budget legislation to appropriate funding to cover the direct costs.
Speaker 0: Those are the costs that are just shared with you. Is there any comments on the bill? I would just like to thank Councilman Morales for bringing the Juneteenth to us. I believe it was in her committee and we passed the legislation.
Speaker 0: So thank you, Castro. Morales So it looks like both holidays will have free parking, so let's be thankful for that. So anyhow, thank you. Not seen any more comments or hands raised. Well, clerk, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 1: Council member Strauss. Yes. Council member Herbold. Yes. Council member Morales.
Speaker 0: Yes.
Speaker 1: Council member. Must gather. I Council Member Nelsen I Council Member Petersen High Council President Juarez.

"
"Speaker 2: Great. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and move a couple of items up. We'll be doing the two items on the recycling issue here. Before we do that, why don't we do it through 24? Briefly, which is the ballot designation.
Speaker 2: Names of submission. Madam Clerk, if you want to read the item.
Speaker 0: Communication from Mayor Garcia. Recommendation to approve the Mayor's designees as argument writers for too Long Beach ballot measures appearing on the June seven, 2016 California statewide election ballot.
Speaker 2: Thank you. We're obviously just following the municipal code and election law here, as per the way the ballot statements are. And you have in front of you the the five we had five folks submit to argue against the first measure, three in favor.
Speaker 2: All five have been added to the list that were that that met the requirement and one person added four against on the second measure. And we had three in favor. You have the list in front of you. There's a motion and a second.
Speaker 2: Is there any public comment on the item? CNN members, please go ahead and cast your vote.
Speaker 0: Motion carries.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Okay. So now let me just one, make sure you know which two they are.
Speaker 0: Item 20 and 27.
Speaker 2: Okay. Item 20 and 27. Unless there's any objection, the way we'll we'll do this is we'll hear maybe the staff report on the whole item, the initial item, and then we will have a we'll take a first take a vote on item 27, which would be the the item from Councilwoman Suzy Price.
Speaker 2: And if that passes, there's no need to then actually do the actual item itself. Is that your preference or.
Speaker 3: That would be my preference. But the item that's appearing on our screen right now, it's 20. Okay, perfect. Thank you.
"
"Speaker 0: Thank you. Item 24.
Speaker 3: And I suppose we didn't want.
Speaker 4: To do that. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Communication from Vice Mayor Andrew's Chair, Housing and Neighborhoods Committee recommendation to approve renaming of the multi-use Sports Court and Marina Vista Park. The link to Sue Johnson Court.
Speaker 0: Vice Mayor Andrews Thank you.
Speaker 4: Me I'd like to turn this over to Councilman Pierce for this price.
Speaker 3: Excuse me.
Speaker 6: Katz Councilwoman Price Thank you. And I want to thank the vice mayor for shepherding this item through the committee and having it here for us. This is kind of the final step of a very, very important item for me, my family and our entire community.
Speaker 6: Luke was an amazing young man. He was diagnosed with leukemia his first week at Wilson High School as a freshman. And he was involved in our Youth Participatory Budgeting Committee that selected the multi-use sport court. And unfortunately, he lost his battle with cancer.
Speaker 6: And we want to honor him by naming the court after him. We'll be having a dedication ceremony this coming Sunday at the park. And I thank my colleagues and again, especially Vice Mayor Andrews, for seeing this item through and making sure that it got here when it did, because the family's been really anxious for this process and
Speaker 6: very excited to have the opportunity to honor Luke as in a permanent space in the district. So thank you, everyone, for your support.
Speaker 4: Thank you very much. Is there any public comment on this? Yes, please. State your name, Larry. Good. You? I fully support this. I think it's an outstanding idea. No ifs, no answer, no votes. I raise a point of order.
Speaker 4: I believe the council the agenda calls for even before this item, whether it is, as it is called, calls for public comment. And I'd like to use that. I have signed up for public comment and this is the time, according to the clerk.
Speaker 4: At the public comment. Is appropriate.
Speaker 9: This is public comment for this item.
Speaker 4: No public comment in general. Having confidence that this is public comment for the item, as you said it has before this item has been was read. The public comment for open public comment. It should have been held first.
Speaker 4: Okay. Okay. You can go read it. All right. Thank you. Please. And that's one of my points more often than not. More often than not, the mayor handles the agenda. Like Seinfeld's Kramer enters and leaves a room. Period.
Speaker 4: That has to stop. That has to stop. No ifs, no answer, no buts. And I would as particularly important and during this comment and I would point out that it'll be we'll have to put up with them there for about another 80 about 16 to 18 months before the attorney general.
Speaker 4: Indict arrest him for the criminal complicity of Marines stated the raising of Marine Stadium to s. That's going to happen. No ifs. No arms, no buts. But as long as the mayor is here, he's got to stop. He has to follow the process.
Speaker 4: And again, not handling, as they say, like Seinfeld's Kramer enters and leaves a room. And I expect that. And I think the public's entitled to that. You can't jerk it around. When you do that, you end up with catastrophes.
Speaker 4: And on that, I'll end my point. But again, we should be giving consideration to who will be the new mayor in about eight to 12 to 18 months, if not sooner, if not sooner. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Speaker 4: Now we go back to the one item 24 together. Yeah, I do. We vote on this one.
Speaker 9: I'll just call for a vote.
Speaker 4: Please.
Speaker 3: No. No.
Speaker 0: Sorry.
Speaker 4: It's.
Speaker 0: Side. My entrance wasn't great. There's I think there's a there's emotion second to approval. And it was.
Speaker 1: The price.
Speaker 3: That was.
Speaker 0: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's suppose not then motion carries Mengers on her chair.
Speaker 0: Am I.
Speaker 1: Councilman Mongo? Councilwoman Mangos? Yes.
Speaker 3: She's a yes. Oh.
Speaker 4: That's hmm.
"
"Speaker 2: So we'll go through these seven items, hopefully expeditiously. Item 27, please.
Speaker 1: Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilwoman Allen. Councilwoman Sara. Recommendation to request City Attorney to draft a resolution in opposition to the recall election of the governor of California.
Speaker 2: Of Vice Mayor Richardson. And on the motion, please.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr.. A second. Proceed. Please. Thank you. Between now and September 14th, Californians are voting in an election that will determine the direction that we take in California and impact our community here in Long Beach and even in our country at large.
Speaker 5: In this election, voters ask the question on your ballot, shall Gavin Newsom be recalled removed from office of governor? Yes or no? That is a ballot measure question that has tremendous impacts on our city. Like any other ballot question, we have the legal authority and I believe the responsibility to demonstrate leadership and take a position that best
Speaker 5: aligns with Long Beach's goals and values. Many residents might ask, what is what does this vote actually mean for the future of Long Beach? I want everyone to know that the stakes are indeed high for quality of life, for the initiatives that we've pursued to create a more just, a more equitable city, a more inclusive Long Beach
Speaker 5: , where every resident is accepted and has an opportunity to thrive. And let's talk about what's at stake. All we need to do is look at the recall supporters statement of reasons. Those advocating for a yes vote say that the governor's support for immigrant rights, conservation and investing in housing and services have to stave off a homelessness emergency
Speaker 5: . Are the wrong things to do. Here in Long Beach. We've done the opposite. We welcome immigrants. We've shown this throughout our history as a city. Most recently, by passing our laws that protect our immigrants and helping reunite migrant families.
Speaker 5: We believe that climate change is real. As a city, we need to prepare for its effects. It's why Long Beach has led the way by creating a climate action adaptation plan and passing measure us to help fund these efforts.
Speaker 5: And we know that the K-Shaped recovery from COVID 19 is also real. While the wealthiest among us continue to do well, we've helped our residents, our residents on the lower leg of that case. We're struggling to recover. We've helped them by providing rental assistance and have so have helped support struggling small businesses who need more support, particularly
Speaker 5: through this COVID 19 pandemic. The progress that we've made as a city as a result, it's a result of us working together with our state and federal government to bring resources back to our communities. That's the progress that is on the line.
Speaker 5: The recall process is intended for youth. When a governor cannot fulfill their duty, fulfill their duty due to personal corruption or unfaithfulness for office. And these are not the reasons that are that the recall supporters have put forward in their petition.
Speaker 5: That's not the reasons. In fact, it's important to recognize that this recall petition started circulating months before COVID 19 even reached our shores. And make no mistake, supporters of this recall seek to unravel the progress that we've made as a city in our fight against COVID 19.
Speaker 5: The Long Beach can't afford to sit this one out. The progress we've made in the city is is too important, and it's on the line. So now is the time for us to take a position, our city's future, and make sure that we understand that this recall election is happening.
Speaker 5: This isn't whether or not we want this recall election, how this is happening. And so we need to respond to this with urgency and take a position of no on question one for the seventh, the September 14th recall election.
Speaker 5: And so I'm happy to move our position of no for the city of Long Beach, a position in opposition of the recall election for the governor of California. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Councilman Allen.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. This election, this recall election is a power grab by special interest who hope to delegitimize the votes that were cast in 2018. It delegitimizes my vote for the governor. This recall election will cost over a quarter of $1,000,000,000.
Speaker 1: And that's a, quote, equivalent to more than half of our general fund. Just for reference. This is a waste of time, energy and money by bet, by special interest. And this is dangerous for our democracy.
Speaker 2: Councilwoman. Councilmember Superman.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Independent of the comments made by my colleagues. I have to make this statement. The recall process is clearly outlined in the California Constitution, Article three, Sections 13 through 19, and in the California elections code. It provides a mechanism for the public to attempt to remove elected public officials from office before the end of their terms
Speaker 5: . I have taken the oath of office on three occasions to serve on the Long Beach City Council. Each time I raise my right hand and I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the State of California, I believe that supporting this agenda item would be a clear violation of my oath of office.
Speaker 5: Therefore, I will be voting in opposition. Thank you.
Speaker 2: They can count. Remember, there's a motion in a second. There is no public comment. Members of his court and Castro notes.
Speaker 1: Motion carries.
"
"Speaker 0: And our speaker is Mr. Ryan Cassidy.
Speaker 3: Good evening. Members of the City Council, my friend Cassidy. I live on Bay Street and I'm opposed this ordinance for several reasons. First off, I believe it's a dishonest ordinance. It's purporting to be about the safety of the food supply.
Speaker 3: And yet, when Council member Odie broached this months ago, the only thing he discussed was layoffs at a particular grocery store. Secondly, it's about an imagined problem, not a real problem. There's, you know, predictions that Wal-Mart's going to be taking over grocery stores.
Speaker 3: But are they doing that? No, it just we're just guessing that's going to be a problem. But my biggest concern is the message it gives to the business community. We have significant vacancies in office space. We have significant vacancies in retail space.
Speaker 3: We got to populate Alameda Point with tenants at some point. And here we are telling the business community that our city council will enact rules about how they can hire and fire people. It's not a real welcoming thing.
Speaker 3: It can turn businesses off. And I think in the long run, it might actually result in fewer jobs in Alameda. So those are my concerns. Thank you.
Speaker 0: You.
Speaker 4: There are a number like to move adoption of. Item five. F I f think you.
Speaker 6: A second.
Speaker 0: Is there any discussion? So I'd like to share that. This this it's my understanding this is being brought to us to approve because there's a California state case that went up to the California state Supreme Court. Supporting the proposition that it is to provide safe food supply to our community.
Speaker 0: And I and I don't want to speak for the other council members, but we have had discussion about that and. And in the end, it only applies to stores that are over 15,000 square feet. Groceries as a high percentage of the store has to have food items.
Speaker 0: Is there anything else that's particularly true that does not provide pertain to stores across the community is very limited. All right. All those in favor. I a motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Regular agenda items.
Speaker 1: Six A receiver report on the Mastic Senior Center 2014 Annual Report.
"
"Speaker 0: Thank you. Congratulations, Central Chair. I would just want to remind the council I. I don't have the cue system. So you won't be recognized using a hand raised hand function or just wave your hand and I can see it and make sure that we don't overlook anyone.
Speaker 0: I believe we have item 15 next to that, correct?
Speaker 1: That is correct. Report from economic report from Economic Development and Public Works. Recommendation to authorize City Manager to enter into an improvement and reimbursement agreement with Kilroy Realty LP for the repair, repaving and re stripping of public right away located within Arrow Long Beach on the stated terms and conditions.
Speaker 1: Authorize City Manager to negotiate and amend any terms as needed to expedite the project and increase appropriations by 2,600,000 for the improvement of Kilroy Airport Way, District four.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Recognize Councilman Shuler? I'll go ahead and make the motion. And taxes are second. It was right hander. I'll take it. And is there any public comment on this item?

"
"Speaker 1: Thank you. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Please read item 34 through the first semicolon.
Speaker 2: Agenda item 34 accountable 118 596 relating to the creation of a Title six business license.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Licata.
Speaker 8: This knowledge is great. This legislation creates a new Title six business license that nearly all businesses engaging in business in the city will be required to obtain. It will be issued currently concurrently with the business license tax certificate that businesses currently obtain under the settlement civil code.
Speaker 8: And there will be no separate fee for the Title six license. In addition, the legislation amends the code to remove the regulatory provisions in that chapter that are not related to the tax code and then pushes the regulatory provisions in the new newly created code, which is basically the permits Title six.
Speaker 8: So what we've done is we've separated the regulatory functions of providing a permit, which would be Title six, from just the acknowledging of doing business in the city. That should be the Title five. This will give the city some greater authority to address any problems that may arise from businesses that are in violation of our codes or
Speaker 8: various laws by, if necessary, suspending the Title six, which would then create the force. The business owner no longer be in business, but the Title five, if it remains in force, will allow us to collect taxes that are due.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Questions or comments? Please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 0: District three.
Speaker 2: And Councilwoman Price.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. I'm glad to see this business coming to the third district. The business is the breakfast bar. It's coming to fourth streets and fourth Street and they have applied for an ABC license. I'm I support them very much with all the fantastic success that they've had at their downtown location.
Speaker 1: I know they're going to be a huge district, district three location for people to enjoy. I do want to clarify a few things on this application. We are conditionally approving the ABC license tonight on the premise that the owners will complete the SIU process.
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's any staff here, but if they are approved for the SIU process and the ABC license will be approved as my understanding, and I see Miss Tatum shaking her head in the affirmative. That is correct.
Speaker 1: Councilwoman Price, I would just offer a couple of distinguishing comments. Typically, a restaurant, unless it has a full service bar, is allowable for what we call a conditional use exemption. And because they have not yet formally submitted, I'm not sure what the status of their proposal is.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay. Thank you. So for anyone who's excited to go there and and partake in beverages, that may not happen until the CFP process is complete. That is correct. Thank you. I urge my colleagues to support this item.
Speaker 2: And, Councilwoman, you like to speak on that? Yeah. Fine, fine. Could you please. There any public comment on this item? If not, will you please cast your vote?

Speaker 1: that this is an outstanding work of a designer or builder. Controls would apply to the site, the building exterior and the entry and stairwell on the interior and on the main entrance. We had the building owners present with us in committee who spoke about the desire to steward this in a historic way for future there themselves.

Speaker 6: This new revenue would fund increased costs for services, capital investments, higher enrollment in the utility discount program, and compliance with financial policies, as well as a proposed 2.7 percentage point increase in this city's solid waste business and occupation tax from a 11.5% to a total of 14.2%, revenue from the solid waste tax is deposited into the general

Speaker 0: Thank you very much. So this is our annual technology matching fund legislation, and it's always an honor to look at these organizations and award them funds. And it's sort of a process I'll describe in a moment here about what our See Tab does.
Speaker 0: But again, this is a meaningful opportunity for us to make community investments intended to address the equity gaps and the digital gap that I think many of us know very well. This year's projects are projected to provide more than 600,000 community matching resources, and they will reach over 6000 residents, 3600 immigrants and refugees, 1500 seniors, 1100 people
Speaker 0: with disabilities, and other residents and workers throughout our city. So let me give a few highlights of these great projects. And again, I want to thank Councilmembers Gonzales and Suarez for, again, a very meaningful discussion at the table.
Speaker 0: The Ethiopian community in Seattle will upgrade their computer lab to provide Ethiopian communities with basic computer literacy classes for seniors and after school computer sciences classes for their youth. The Coalition for Refugees from Burma are awarded funds to provide computer literacy classes at Bailey Elementary and the Seattle World School and offer parent technology mentoring classes to support

Speaker 0: They'll upgrade a computer lab.

Keen on community health care. And they're going to expand the senior friendly kitchen on Smart Lab that a senior friendly technology lab designed to enable Asian seniors
Speaker 0: in my that it's age 60 plus to increase technology and health literacy to prevent social isolation and increase access to health care and digital resources. Launch Code. They will provide 20 week computer programing classes that enables people with barriers to employment and technology to gain highly marketable tech skills.
Speaker 0: The North Seattle Boys and Girls Club Branch actually the Wallingford Boys and Girls Club in District four. They'll install new 14 desktop computer lab for 250 low income youth to use for homework help and hands on learning activities.

Speaker 0: literacy and access technology in the West African community. And last a wing luke Museum of the Asia Pacific American Experience will provide a mobile digital media lab for low income youth. And establishes mobile lab to improve, provide Asian Pacific American youth.
Speaker 0: And so before we vote on this, I do want to just make two points that came out of the discussions, one being that as we are now by districts that the you I want to thank the community technology technology advisory board, the volunteers looking at these under looking at these awards and looking at underrepresented communities.
Speaker 0: But now that we are by districts, I think a message we'll work offline with them as make sure that that the district representation filter is sort of part of the consideration as they move forward because we want to make sure that that is factored in.
Speaker 0: And then I think Councilmember Gosar made a point that we look at, again, how we award these presentations. If we there might be a possibility where we have an oral presentation part or at least utilize that as one tool to make sure that some groups that might be able to do a little better than that, that make
Speaker 0: sure that we're using the right filters to reach our communities were intended to do. And and that would be a good opportunity to sort of reset, if we will, how these awards are done. I think we're doing a great job of always improving those.
Speaker 0: That was the tenor of the conversation. We had a community at the at the committee table. Okay. That was a mouthful. Thanks for your patience. And you can get off your email and get ready to vote. Everybody set any questions or any comments.
Speaker 0: Okay, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 5: Martin Luther nailed it to the door. Say, this is what we want to do. Don't try to sneak around at the last minute. At the end of the day or at the end of the first reading, this was what the distant from the majority of the council people.

"
"Speaker 5: The report Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development and Arts Committee. Agenda Item one Capital 11958 4,000,000,002 residential rental properties conforming to Zell Miller code with changes in state law. The committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 1: Just remember Herbold.
Speaker 5: Fantastic. Thank you. So back in February of 2019, I sponsored Resolution 31861 that proposed certain legislative changes originating from recommendations from the Women's Commission in the Housing Justice Project Report Losing Home. The recommendations in the report identified specific harms in our eviction system, impacting tenants in marginalized communities, particularly women, the African-American community, seniors and transpeople.
Speaker 5: Following up on Resolution 31861, passed unanimously by the Council in the 2019 state legislative session, advocates at the state level and housing champions were in were successful in passing changes to the Residential Landlord Tenant Act Senate Bill 5600 was sponsored by Senators Patty Couteur and Mona Das and House Bill 1440, sponsored by Representatives Jordan Robertson and Nicole
Speaker 5: Macri. These bills have been in effect since the end of July and SDI, the Department of Construction Inspections, is already conducting outreach and education on the changes in this bill. They've been working to notify landlords who are currently registered with the rental registration and inspection database, about 19,000 landlords, and they've been incorporating into future landlord trainings and
Speaker 5: curriculum the new requirements under state law. This harmonization bill that is before us today makes consistent with our own unique city laws the new rights granted to tenants by state law. It passed unanimously out of the August 13th Civil Rights Utility's Economic Development and Arts Committee.
Speaker 5: What the legislation does is three primary things. First, it extends what was a mere three days that tenants had to pay rent or face eviction, for which they a reason for not paying the rent would not be accepted by a judge is only looks at whether or not the rent was paid within three days.
Speaker 5: The new law gives tenants 14 days for nonpayment of rent. This extends the amount of time a tenant has to access services, support or the next pay period in order to potentially get up, get caught up and avoid eviction proceedings.
Speaker 5: Secondly, the bill redefines rent as, quote, recurring and periodic charges identified in the rental agreement. The reason why this is so important is it allows a requirement that rent be applied past due, rent be applied before other costs like lease late payments damages, legal costs or other fees.
Speaker 5: And so that makes sure that when a tenant is behind in rent and also has other costs owing like late fees, that when the tenant pays the past due rent, it gets applied to the rent that is showing to be owed and ensures that the reinstatement of tenancy is based on on that rent and not the other
Speaker 5: costs. And then finally, the bill extends the minimum notice of all rent increases in the city of Seattle to 60 days. And under current law, most rent increases can only go into effect after 30 days notice. With the exception in Seattle for rent increases greater than 10%, they previously required a 60 day notice.
Speaker 5: Under this new law, all rent increases, regardless of their size, will only be effective with a full 60 days notice. And those are the main points of the bill. We're going to have another couple of pieces of legislation that we're going to be continuing to work through, through our committee.
Speaker 5: Also coming out of the Women's Commission Housing Justice Project, Losing Home Report. But we'll talk about that another time.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Any questions or comments on the legislation? Okay. Looks like we're good. So please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 2: Thanks. John Gonzalez. Purple. Hi, Suarez. Let's get to O'Brien Pacheco. So what? President Harrell.

Speaker 4: Yes. Our first speaker is Dave Shukla.
Speaker 6: Hello. Dave Chappelle. Just very briefly, I'm looking forward to seeing how this point in the budget process evolves next year and every two year increments through 2030. And how we manage as a city, what happens after the Olympics and really looking at the Century Foundation as kind of a guide to doing it right the first time yet
Speaker 6: . Thank you very much.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Our next speaker is carelessly you.
Speaker 4: Look.
Speaker 6: Hi, this is Corliss Lee. And looking at the budget where we're planning on furloughs, layoffs and salary cuts for frontline city employees to balance the budget. I'm having a hard time reconciling some of the other moves that are made.
Speaker 6: We are in an era of tightening our belts. Budget shortfalls are expected. What was the criteria by which budgeting decisions were made? I have to question that $85 million swimming pool is essential. Santa monica built a pool on the beach for 30 million.
Speaker 6: Who benefits from this? The trees.
Speaker 2: Along Willow and Eldorado Park.
Speaker 6: Are already turning orange. Is that a reduction in watering? Are we giving up watering the.
Speaker 2: Parks.
Speaker 6: While at the same time taking a $1.5 million soccer field that was planned surreptitiously became a $2.3 million soccer field. Are we planning on replacing it with a new potable watering system? What are the benefits? Who benefits? Is it.
Speaker 2: Necessary?
Speaker 6: Then I look at raises. Raises for the city auditor who's already in the 200 K Club. Does that make sense when you're laying people off? Raise this for city council. And then hiding that fact from the public. This is the year you should have frozen salary.
Speaker 6: I really can't understand your budgeting process. Thank you.

Speaker 4: There is no public comment for this item.

Are there any significant stipulations in this contract that we need to be aware of or the public need to be aware of
Speaker 5: ? Um. Yes, in this contract. I think we're good to go. I do want to bring something that is new that came up in December 2021. There has been a new board motion by the MTA to require vaccinations for everybody who is working on the airline.
Speaker 5: So that policy is something that we are actively reviewing and looking at. It's not completely formatted yet, and we will bring that back to you about what any potential implications would be depending on where and, you know, what motions that they have in the city's process of requiring vaccinations.
Speaker 2: All right. Thank you. And I want to know and I know this is important this is important to Mayor Garcia, and he would be here, but he's at US Conference of Mayors this week. And so I just wanted to lift that up.
Speaker 2: But Councilwoman Allen, anything.
Speaker 0: Yes. Just just really briefly, I just want to say that this contract is key to providing rapid responses and safe spaces that I metro trains and platforms that are. And I want to thank Supervisor Janice Hahn for her support of our local law enforcement and providing these services and also to our wonderful Mayor Garcia, for getting this
Speaker 0: contract set up in the first place. Our continued support as we push to increase the quality of life for homeless outreach that is also provided in this contract. And I can tell you, you know, especially living downtown, I know the difference.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?
Speaker 0: I think this is a very good view, clear consideration. This is a commendable project. The only concern I have is relative to the dancing and what type of dancing there will be. Will we be saddled with the type of.
Speaker 0: Sidestepping or tap dancing around the truth, such as we get almost every time Robert Garcia opens his mouth. You can see what can be done to stop that type of dancing. That's something you have to consider before you approve it.
Speaker 0: And I think you have excellent examples of how proficient he is if dancing around the truth and sidestepping the facts and truth. Give that some consideration when you issue this permit.
Speaker 8: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you. General public comment on this item. Mrs. Price was not clear if he thinks.
Speaker 9: Ask urge my colleagues to support this item. This hotel is located right next to the Gaslamp, where it currently is dancing. There's no dancing, sidestepping the truth, but there are sidesteps when they do their country Sunday line dancing.
Speaker 9: But this is this is just straight up dancing. Mr. Good here.
Speaker 2: Councilman.
Speaker 14: I thank you. And I'm happy to support this. I'm not sure how this has progressed, but I can remember several years ago entertained going to the Golden Cells Sunday nights for reggae and having a great time. So I wouldn't want to deprive anybody of that experience here in Long Beach.

Speaker 0: Councilmember O'Brien.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So a current development is a development company owned by Amazon. So this this ordinance or granting is related to the properties adjacent to their campus where the spheres are. As folks may recall a couple of years ago when they started development on that project, they are to an agreement with the building across the street from
Speaker 2: the Western Building, which is hosts a bunch of computer facilities there or data warehouse. And the agreement was that they would capture the heat that is put off in the computers, heat, water, bring the water across the street to their facilities and use that waste heat from the computers to heat those buildings.
Speaker 2: That project has been moving forward very successfully. This ordinance today would allow them to expand across a couple of streets to future parcels they're planning to develop and use that same waste heat to heat additional buildings.
Speaker 0: Very good energy for the comments. That please call the role on the passage of the bill.

"Speaker 1: The bill passes and the chair of Senate. Please read the next agenda item.
Speaker 6: Agenda Item six Council 119 543 relating to Lenny since any amending seven sometimes because sections 23.50 5.002.003.005 and 23.84 8.0 36. To add new assembly sections 23.50 5.0 52.00. 54.0. 56.0. 57.0. 59.0 62. Subject Design Overlay Districts and sign regulations for the Sale Center, including regulations for sub areas containing the Seattle Center area excuse me, arena and
Speaker 6: the brassy garage block. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. So this last piece of legislation is basically creating what we call the sign overlay district, and by that it amends the land use code to define a sign overlay district that basically provides the tailoring of the sign code provisions at the Seattle Center.
Speaker 1: The both the developers and city leaders and those sort of vested in the project believe this is absolutely necessary incident and sort of a catalyst for wayfinding and for the creation of vibrancy in the Seattle center. And so the signage which do illuminate but they're not like Las Vegas type signs but are necessary for wayfinding and again
Speaker 1: , creating the vibrancy that we want to see at Seattle Center Arena. We had a robust conversation, I thought, at the committee table, and there was some concern by both the design commission and some folks testified about sort of a be careful approach or whether this is the best approach.
Speaker 1: But we heard, I thought from the executive and the department some fairly compelling testimony in terms of how they limit the use of signs. There's actually a total reduction of the amount of signage by 2000 square feet that was allowed in the original lease, the hours that science could be illuminated, etc. all seem to be reasonable and
Speaker 1: as determined by the committee. And so this justice, this legislation was overwhelmingly passed out of committee. And we think it's the wise way to go. Any questions or comments with that? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.

"
"Speaker 3: Agenda Item nine Resolution 316 75 related to the Seattle Police Department over time usage and progress reports to the Gender Equity, Safe Communities and New Americans Committee on Implementation of City Auditor Recommendations from the April 2016 Overtime Audit.
Speaker 3: The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Gonzalez.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Council President Harrell This is a resolution related to the Seattle Police Department overtime usage and progress reports that will be required from the Department to the Gender Equity Safe Communities and Americans Committee on implementation of a set of 30 recommendations from the City Auditor from the April 2016 overtime audit.
Speaker 3: In essence, as I mentioned this morning, the chief of police, when she first arrived, I think about three or four months after she arrived as our chief of police made we made a request to our city city auditor's office to have the overtime usage and processes and tools at the Seattle Police Department be subject to an audit
Speaker 3: by the city auditor. As the result of that particular request, there were 30 recommendations that were issued by the city auditor related to some failings in control systems at the Seattle Police Department. And all of those 30 recommendations were accepted by the police department.
Speaker 3: And this resolution is intended to, in a in a different way, impose upon the Seattle Police Department clear milestones and deadlines and expectations around deliverables in terms of how it is they are complying with the auditor's recommendations. This this resolution, in my mind, is critically important to ensure that we continue to have a police department that is
Speaker 3: accountable, not just in police misconduct, police accountability, police discipline issues, but also on the operations side. And I think that Councilmember Burgess made a very fine point in committee last week when we heard from the department that they would like to engage in a conversation around whether the overtime budget allocated to the department is accurate.
Speaker 3: In response to that, Councilmember Burgess indicated that. Why don't we try to figure out how to get this house in order before we throw more money at the house? And so I think that that's an important point. My hope is that this overtime resolution will steer us in that direction so that we are making sure that the
Speaker 3: money that the Seattle Police Department does have for purposes of overtime is being utilized efficiently and effectively and transparently. Before we dove into these two, which is is the overtime budget set at the appropriate levels, yes or no?
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Gonzales. Any further comments from any of my colleagues for questions? CNN. Those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries, the resolution stopped and then Charles signed it.

"Speaker 1: Item 21.
Speaker 0: A report from Economic and Property Development and Development Services recommendation to adopt specifications for the purchase and development opportunity at 4800 Long Beach Boulevard. Declare the property a surplus and authorize the city manager to execute all necessary documents with city ventures for the sale of the property in the amount of 1.2 million District eight.
Speaker 1: Councilman Austin.
Speaker 10: Thank you. And this is this is a good day for the district. This property has been vacant for many, many years, has gone through some machinations and some some. Some visions. But but ultimately, this was put on an RFP.
Speaker 10: The original RFP came back with no interest. And then so the city reissued the RFP and we were fortunate to get three bids. And this bid turned out to be the bid recommended by staff. But based on what I have reviewed, I think this is a great project that will bring proposals to bring condominiums to the Long
Speaker 10: Beach Boulevard in an area that has been blighted for far too long. And so, members, I ask for your support on this matter.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Richardson.
Speaker 4: Congratulations, Councilmember Austin. More quality housing in North Long Beach.

Speaker 4: Okay.
Speaker 7: Alex Vasquez will get the step forward.
Speaker 0: Good evening, Mayor and city council. I'm going to turn it over to Jolene Richardson.
Speaker 1: She's our risk manager and she'll give a brief overview of this particular report. Even the mayor and council. This is for the city's annual renewal, for the excess workers compensation insurance, which is important for us to continue to provide coverage for our employees.
Speaker 1: It also helps us to reduce our negative financial consequences for our high exposures or losses that may result from injuries or deaths due to accidents, fire or terrorist attacks and earthquakes during work hours. This coverage will be obtained through the city's casualty.
Speaker 0: Broker for a record.
Speaker 1: Alliant Insurance Services. This year's policy for excess workers compensation will continue to provide 150 million and coverage access of 5 million self-insured retention at a premium of $505,134, which represents an increase of approximately 6.6% from the expiring policy due to increase in city's payroll.

"
"Speaker 0: Chauncey Billups. So it's going to be an incredible time, and I just wanted to share that because it's been a long time coming. All right. Presentations tonight, we have a presentation from Stephen Jones of The Hive Industries to present a social impact project out in Council District nine.
Speaker 0: So. All right. Go right ahead, Stephen.
Speaker 6: Well, first off.
Speaker 8: Thanks, Councilman Brooks, for inviting us. My name is Steven Jones as my partner Tim Arquilla. And we're here representing Hive Industries. This is a nonprofit event, space and resource center that we've developed over the last four years. Now finding it's home at 725 West 39th and the Fox.
Speaker 8: Fox, what is it, Fox Island near here. But so our concept is based off social capitalism. We think social capitalism is a real thing. And we've created an ecosystem where every entertainment dollar that comes into our building, a portion of that goes to supporting nonprofits and community organizations.
Speaker 8: So as well as artists and musicians. So as a five points Denver native, a product of Denver public schools. The. Sorry my heart is pounding. First time public speaking exactly. A product of Denver. Denver School of the Arts.
Speaker 8: You know, we wanted to create an ecosystem and a organization that supported artists and young community organizations. So that's what the hive industry is. The event center is called the Fox Street Compound. We offer nonprofit consulting program, Incubation Resource Exchange, all in this four acre event field, the old power rental building.
Speaker 8: So but one of the wonderful things that we've created is called Give Back Tickets that sits on top of our nonprofit resource space. It's a social impact platform. It sells tickets, but just like it says, give back tickets, a portion of those service fees go to community benefactors, which is really cool because, you know, obviously everybody pays
Speaker 8: service fees with tickets, but how can we yeah, how can we help organizations? See what else we got here. We have office space, so currently we house five nonprofits, all very young nonprofits. One is Plant the Seed, a project that we'll be producing this summer is the ugly food farmer's market at our event center.
Speaker 8: So every Wednesday we'll have a farmer's market of basically that ugly food, food that doesn't make it to the store shelves of King Soopers and everybody else. So uptake I think growers organic plant the seed and the factory compound.
Speaker 8: We'll be providing that service within our community, servicing the Swansea Globeville district and the Sunnyside area there. We also have a community garden space up on 38th and Sheridan that we've had for about four years and have fostered many great programs with, you know, developing youth and and growing.
Speaker 8: So we're just here to share our vision and say hello, basically.
Speaker 0: Great. And see what can you show us at one site that shows how many thousands of people come to this site?
Speaker 8: Yeah. So our biggest fundraiser brings 25,000 people to the site over a two day period. It's called the Denver Taco Festival and.
Speaker 6: Tacos, right? Yeah.
Speaker 8: Yeah. And so that event itself started in the Reno district and has moved from the 32nd and Larimer block over to this area. And over the four years that it's been running, we've raised over $300,000 for nonprofit organizations, and we have a handful of other events coming to great.
Speaker 0: And I wanted you know, this council sees many rezonings in this Fox Island area, but few people really know what's actually going on in the existing infrastructure and how that existing infrastructure is being used. And so I thought it was important that folks here on council in the city understands that there are folks who are making the
Speaker 0: existing infrastructure work for the community, for folks who are there right now. So that's great.
Speaker 8: Well, thanks so much.
Speaker 0: Well, thank you again. I appreciate it. All right. All right. Madam Secretary, do you have any communications.
"
"Speaker 0: Yeah, thank you, Councilman Cashman. Looks like we have no other announcements, but we do have one presentation this evening. Tonight we have a presentation from Clear Parker Robinson Dance to highlight the opening of their photo exhibit, the premiere of Carmen.
Speaker 0: Many of us know her as Mama Cleo on the northeast side of Denver. So you want to come up to the.
Speaker 4: First of all, thank you so much for having a moment. And I just want to thank our wonderful Councilwoman Ortega and, of course, our our chair, who is in our district. And we're so proud. Now, I have an extraordinary weekend, but we have our ambassador of Mexico right with us.
Speaker 4: And I wanted our Ambassador Rendon to please come and join me because it is rare that we get her with this wonderful exhibit that we will be sharing at first at our theater starting on Friday night, Friday night.
Speaker 4: It begins the exhibit. And this is an extraordinary exhibit of Amalia Hernandez and her daughter is carrying on that legacy of the national dance company Folklorico de Mexico. And it is really 100 years that we're celebrating and not 100 years of Cleopatra Robinson dance.
Speaker 4: I've only been doing it for 47 years, but I've been in a building that's almost 100 years. But I would like for you to say a few words, if you would. Thank you very much. And good afternoon, everyone.
Speaker 4: Thank you, city councilors, for receiving us here this year.
Speaker 5: The consulate of.
Speaker 4: Mexico is celebrating the 125th anniversary that it was first established in Denver by precedent for future years. And we are having some activities along the year. First of all, we are going to start this weekend with a picture for the exhibition of Amalia Mendez, the founder of the ballet Folklorico de México.
Speaker 4: And she has set the example for all the girls all over the world. So we thank you for hosting this announcement and we need to tell you about it.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 4: With our opening. We have three premieres and they happen in Denver first and then they will travel the country and the world. And that is what we love doing, is sharing the magic of the powerful artists that we have.
Speaker 4: So our first work is at La Malattia of Cordoba, and I think it's really amazing. A historical work that we will be sharing starting Friday night will play Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So we want to invite the council to be there.
Speaker 4: We then have another work by Donal McHale, and Donal McHale is one of our American choreographers and he just made his transition one month ago. But he left a legacy of work that Broadway, New York, everywhere around the world knows his name as a choreographer.
Speaker 4: So we carry his work as a lead, a legacy work. And then my last work is Carmen and I will be performing Carmen. I choreographed it with a bossa nova approach. I did it with the symphony in 1989 or somewhere along there at Bettcher, and we opened it there, but we're doing it at our theater, bringing a
Speaker 4: sense of jazz, celebrating jazz in this country. And so we want you to join us. One of the things we realized and I wanted to thank Janelle Ayanna for making this connection between our companies in Denver and in Mexico City.
Speaker 4: She has just done a phenomenal job and of course, our staff, but has said has made material available for you. So let us know if you can join us, because it is a historic moment and we thank you for this time.
Speaker 4: I say. I say.
Speaker 0: I say. Thank you so much. Madam Ambassador, you are welcome here any time. Thank you so much. And of course, Mama. Cleo, we hope next time you can perform. Because, you know, once, once a month we have a performance for our Vision 2020 Plan for the Arts.
Speaker 0: So. Thank you. Okay, great. All right, we have. That was our presentation. Madam Secretary, you have any communications?
"
"Speaker 0: Thank you. Item 11.
Speaker 1: Communication from Councilwoman Mongeau, Councilwoman Zendejas Councilmember Your Urunga recommendation directs city manager to review and report back within 90 days on parks, roadway and parking lot maintenance.
Speaker 0: Councilwoman.
Speaker 3: Thank you. I was trying to text. Motion to the Q. Thank you for everyone who has contributed to this item. Our community has really reached out related to some challenges that we have found in understanding how. Potholes that are not on residential and commercial corridors, residential streets, commercial corridors or the other types of public streets that we
Speaker 3: have actually get filled. We've been working on a particular pothole for months, and sometimes these potholes get reported through the garbage out hundreds of times and still no resolution. And that's just not acceptable. I know that interior roads and our park facilities and our our parking lots often have some of the worst potholes in the city.
Speaker 3: And while I'm not looking to pull resources from one area to another, I think it's important for there to be a united method in which people can communicate with the city about a pothole and the need to repair it.
Speaker 3: Because what's happening is a pothole reported at a small size left unrepaired for months on end, actually grows to a size where the cost of repairing that pothole has grown exponentially. So we really need to figure out how to pull together a united pothole program.
Speaker 3: I think that's kind of the theme of my two items tonight, which is understanding that within our city we do a lot of great things, but sometimes they're broken up into different departments and this is one of those times.
Speaker 3: And so I'd like the city manager to look at that and come back and. He's already committed to filling the pothole issue that we have. That's been an ongoing issue, but that issues like this should not be bounced around from public works to Parks and Rec for months on end, with residents feeling totally disenfranchized and frustrated.
Speaker 3: So I appreciate everyone's support on this important item.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Zendejas.

Speaker 8: This is an area of the dog beach that was expanded recently from 2.9 acres to 4.1 acres. We did have a permit before from the Coastal Commission for this area. This would just update that permit to include the entire area of the 4.9 acres.
Speaker 8: So it was a recent increase.
Speaker 11: In the size of the dog area. And so we'll also be putting some delineate in that dog area that some art pieces that we should be installing fairly soon in the dog beach area.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Pryce.
Speaker 3: Q I want to thank the staff. This is a very exciting project for us. We love having a dog beach. Our residents really enjoy having the opportunity to be able to have a space that they can take their dogs to because otherwise they would not be able to have their dogs on the beach.
Speaker 3: So the fact that we are putting some resource and thought into this particular service for the residents of the city of Long Beach and also visitors is very exciting. I want to thank the Parks Rec and Marine staff for working on this project.
Speaker 3: I know this is an item that we talk about at our monthly meetings and I'm glad to see that it's moving forward. So thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. And this is also my my dog's favorite place probably in the city is the dog beach. So love it. Any public comment?
Speaker 8: Please come forward. Very good. You click as it has two items on first of all. I'm dead set. I think it makes absolutely no sense to spend money on art. Work down in an area like that would simply get graffitied over in trash, period.
Speaker 8: There's no. Oh. What has to do is look at the look at the underside or look at any building along the along the bike path or the underside of the Belmont Pier. And you'll see how destructive it is of graffiti lady.
Speaker 8: A leading it is on the demarcations, I suppose I suggested to the county meeting. I think that best it. Would not cost that much money to mark it off. But just simply put tube made maybe out of styrofoam and a rubber large fire hydrants.
Speaker 8: What better for and for marking a dog park period clearly recognizable by the dogs.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Okay, thank you. And the other public comment saying none. Please cast your vote.

"Speaker 1: 06830683 Council of the Marine and Louisiana offered the following order for a hearing to discuss solutions to historic and disproportionate state disinvestment in the city of Boston.
Speaker 3: The chair recognizes counsel Braden and counsel Braden. You have the full.
Speaker 2: Where's my notes? Thank you, Mr. President. I want to extend my appreciation to cancer Louisiana for her willingness to lead on this issue with me. Despite her absence today through this year's budget process, we dug deeper into to get a better understanding not just of the figures and numbers from each individual department, but the Office of Budget
Speaker 2: Management's narrative analyzing trends in the city's fiscal condition over the span of several years. A couple of weeks ago, I filed orders related to city personnel and the state of the public sector workforce. After reviewing 20 years of staffing level data, revealing some striking trends, only looking at the current year and the past couple of years didn't
Speaker 2: show the historic trends. The same is the case for Boston's relationship with the state. We have to look at the long view to understand the big picture. Over the past 20 years, the city's net revenue in state aid has been reduced by over 300 million per year or a 70% reduction.
Speaker 2: Our state aid has been dropping, but but year over year, our state assessments for charter school tuition and the MTA climb exponentially. The result is in our budget, year after year is increased reliance on property taxes for a revenue source.
Speaker 2: 20 years ago, the property tax accounted for 55% of our revenue. Now, 20 years later, it's expected to reach 75% of our revenue. This relationship is unsustainable for the city and our residents. In 2006, Mayor Menino commissioned the BRT research department to conduct a report called Boston Gives More Than It Gets from the Rest of Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: It found that we generate more than our fair share of state instead jobs, state tax revenue, state income, corporate excise, and business tax revenue, visitor revenue, and state hotel tax revenue. But we do not get our fair share.
Speaker 2: It was a problem then, and it is a problem now. We have an opportunity to forge transformative partnerships with our colleagues at the state level. We have a mayor and city council whose policies at times require state approval that move at a glacial pace.
Speaker 2: We know our home rule petitions take forever. Like the CBA reforms reform bills submitted in 2019, which is still hasn't moved anywhere. If the state is going to pursue targeted scrutiny and oversight of the city of Boston, we should we should assess what is and isn't working from the current relationship for the interests of the city.
Speaker 2: Looking ahead, I believe we need a more proactive collaboration with this with the Boston delegation members, including those in leadership roles such as the leaders from my district and those chairing committees like Ways and Means at the State House.
Speaker 2: We also are looking at the possibility of a governor from the city sitting in the corner office in less than a year from now. This the council, the mayor's administration and members of the Boston delegation should be strategizing a game plan for the city to achieve real, tangible results and receive its fair share.
Speaker 2: To to right the many wrongs that have been done to us over the past several decades. Another swap this hearing order is about. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Counsel Brennan. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? Would anyone like to add their name, please? Raise your hand, Mr. Kirk. Please add Councilor Royal Councilor Borg. Councilor Coletta called Councilor Maria. Councilor, we are all counsel of clarity.

"Speaker 1: The finance director and Bond Staff Balance Council. And I believe the letter of creditors is also joining. So they are coming in momentarily.
Speaker 0: Coming in. Okay, great. I see Ms.. TOS name on the screen and now I see her in person. Welcome. Hi.
Speaker 4: Thank you. Good. Good evening.
Speaker 1: Mayor. And some members of the City Council. My name is Anita.
Speaker 4: I'm here to present this item for you tonight. With me tonight is also.
Speaker 1: Up on council.
Speaker 4: Ryan Quinn, as well as members from.
Speaker 1: Wells Fargo team who are here to answer any questions you may have. Just a little bit of background in April of 2016. Union Bank was hired by the city to.
Speaker 4: Provide a letter of credit for the Alameda Public Financing Authority Variable Rate Demand Bonds known as Alameda Point Improvement Project.
Speaker 1: For $9,080,000.23 Series A and 4,000,003 360,000.
Speaker 4: For the 2003 Series.
Speaker 1: B bonds for the taxable taxable bonds.
Speaker 4: As background, Alameda Public Financing Authority issued a total of approximately 12.4 million and variable rate bonds.
Speaker 1: Related to allow me to point in 2003, the source of repayment for these bonds as a rental income received from properties managed by the city's Base Reuse Department. Union Bank expired in.
Speaker 4: The LLC, with Union.
Speaker 1: Bank expire in June 14 of 2021. Fortunately, the city was able to receive an extension until November 15, 2021. With that extension, however, Union Bank increased the fee from 115 basis point to 125 basis points.
Speaker 4: Plus they charge a one time fee of 5000 for the one time extension.
Speaker 1: Union Bank has told us that they will not extend the LLC beyond the November 2021 expiration date. The market for the city's LLC is very limited because of the small size of the outstanding bonds. Typically, banks prefer large deals so they can.
Speaker 4: Fine spread the cost of the.
Speaker 1: Transaction over the size of the bonds. So the city reach out to other banks about providing a.
Speaker 4: Letter of credit only.
Speaker 1: To banks to express interest.
Speaker 4: U.S. Bank in Wells Fargo.
Speaker 1: Wells Fargo stepped.
Speaker 4: Up and submitted a term sheet which offer a three year.
Speaker 1: LLC at 100 basis points to the city. So is my.
Speaker 4: Recommendation that we proceed with the substitution of the letter of credit. A bond counsel, Brian Quinn, is here to answer.
Speaker 1: Any questions that you may have. Thank you very much.
Speaker 0: Thank you for that clear and concise report. Ms.. TA And Madam Clerk, I meant to ask, do we have public speakers on this item?
Speaker 1: We do not.
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'll close public comment. So then, counsel, I will open the floor to counsel for any clarifying questions for a motion. What's your pleasure? By my count, from every next flight.
Speaker 3: I'd be happy to move approval of the staff provider resolutions.
Speaker 0: All right, Councilmember Spencer. All right. Any further council discussion? All right. We really appreciate all you representatives of Wells Fargo, Aspen Council for being here. Welcome. We'll get you home early tonight. Okay. So seeing no discussion. Madam, may we have a roll call vote, please.

"
"Speaker 1: Madam Court, could you please read docket 1239?
Speaker 0: Certainly. Docket 1239. The Committee on Government Operations, to which was referred on December 1st, 2021, docket number 1239 message an order authorizing the creation of a sheltered market program in conformity with the requirements of general laws. Chapter 30 B Section 18.
Speaker 0: This authorization applies to contracts for goods, professional services and support services. This authorization is for no more than six contracts, which must be awarded by June 30th, 2022. This sheltered market program shall be available for disadvantaged, minority and women only vendors, for whom there is a demonstrated substantial disparity in the city's 2020 disparities.
Speaker 0: Study submits a report recommending the order ought to pass.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. The Chair recognizes Councilor Edwards, chair of the committee. Councilor Edwards.
Speaker 2: You have the floor. This is this is actually a matter, I believe, sponsored by the.
Speaker 8: Mayor in Cannes.
Speaker 2: In conformance with the recommendations from the disparity study and making sure that we opt in to this this pilot program under mass general laws 30 Section 18. Again, it's really just following the recommendations of an already studied issue, which which demonstrates a disparity between minority contractors or women contractors receiving contracts in the city of Boston.
Speaker 2: So this would allow for us to shepherd and move these six contracts to those already designated groups who have a disadvantage. And I think it's.
Speaker 8: Really fulfilling a promise.
Speaker 2: Of making sure that we go through and make sure all aspects of the city government, including the financial benefits, are accessible to people in the city of Boston. I recommend that this pass and I hope that my colleagues will vote for it.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much. Councilor Edward seeks acceptance of the committee report and passage of Docket 1239. Madam Court, could you please call the roll?

Speaker 0: Certainly Docket 0863 order for hearing to discuss pest control and illegal dumping in the city of Boston.
"
"Speaker 2: Okay. Unanimous. Okay. So both items to be continued for two weeks. Came, Madam Kirk. Next item.
Speaker 0: Item 16 Report from Economic and Property Development. Recommendation to execute an amendment to agreement with area to cover civic center consulting costs of $450,000 between February 15, 2016 and the anticipated execution of the Project Agreement no later than April 29, 2016.
Speaker 0: District two. Thank you. There's been a motion in a second. Councilman Gonzalez. Council member supernova. Was that a mistake? Did you, woman? No. Thank you. There's been a motion in a second on this item. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address the Council on item 16?
Speaker 0: Please come forward.
Speaker 7: Surprise. Let Larry go to you. Clark has the address. Yet another half a million dollars for the buffoonery of this complex being rebuilt. I think, again, that speaks well for the case of. Firing the city manager, replacing the mayor with a federal master to oversee.
Speaker 7: The financial operations of this city. I mean this the immediate action that you. Some of you were forced into doing. Others were not somebody like council person price had them the intelligence to see if you've got the second largest contract in the city's history for the year.
Speaker 7: It deserves much more scrutiny than was given. And here again, we have yet another example of buffoonery. And I would suggest probably every other week we're going to be getting things like this again and again. I just hope we can.
Speaker 7: The Feds can come here fast enough. Before we had. At least something standing. And I had. And at that point, I was also one other comment relative to the good, smooth final comments of the councilman or anger. I appreciate him saying those remarks and clarifying his remarks on that because nobody wants nobody wants the stench that comes
Speaker 7: from the 13th floor. Permanently attached to them. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Hey. Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Please cast your vote. Members, please cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you. Item 17. Report from Long Beach Gas and Oil Recommendation to approve and adopt the Long Beach Unit Annual Plan Citywide.
"
"Speaker 0: . We've talked a lot about affordable housing in these chambers, and we talk a lot about our most vulnerable residents are homeless and are low income residents. But we also have, you know, expressed our concern for middle income residents who can't afford to stay in Denver.
Speaker 0: This is one of those programs that is for those middle income, moderate income families who are interested in becoming homeowners. And so I just wanted to take a moment to make the public aware of what this is. The mortgage credit certificate basically allows you to get a credit on your federal taxes up to 30% of the interest
Speaker 0: that you spent in a year. So everybody across the United States, under current rules, gets to deduct interest payments from their income. It lowers your income and therefore lowers your tax liability. This program allows you dollar for dollar to deduct from your actual tax payment.
Speaker 0: So if you owe the IRS $500 and you are going to get, you know, a $100 credit from your interest payment, you get to take that off what you owe the IRS. So it's a really great program for helping to make homeownership work.
Speaker 0: Whether you put that 100 bucks back into a home repair or just making the next mortgage payment. So I wanted to just make sure folks know they can find out about it. On Denver Gov Dawgs search for mortgage credit certificate and it is mostly for home first time homebuyers, although you can also receive it if you're in
Speaker 0: a targeted area that's a little bit distressed in our city or for some veterans. And the income limits are are really for those middle income families all the way up to $95,000 a year for two to adult household.
Speaker 0: So it really does help folks in that bracket buy homes in Denver. And it's actually out of funds right now. So we're really, really thanking my colleagues for their anticipated vote in support of this to keep helping homeowners buy homes in Denver.
Speaker 0: Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Canete. See no other comments. Madam Secretary, can you tidy up the next one, which I believe was 828, called out by Councilwoman Fox and Councilwoman Fox. What would you like for us to do with this?
Speaker 6: I would like to put on the floor for a vote, and it is the same thing as 867. So if you could put both of those together.
Speaker 3: Certainly, Councilman Ortega, we make the motion for us this evening.
Speaker 11: I'd be happy to.
Speaker 3: Could you put 828 and 867 on them for final consideration and do pass in a block on the floor.
"
"Speaker 1: Business. That's right. Item 23 is a report from the Office of Councilmember Patrick O'Donnell, Councilwoman Geri Sheepskin Councilmember Stephen Neil with a recommendation to request city manager to prepare a letter of support for Assembly Bill 1839, also known as the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act.
Speaker 11: It's on the calendar.
Speaker 9: Joining us over to Councilmember O'Donnell.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I take council I ask you to weigh in in support of AB 1839. That's the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act. Since the late 1990s, film production has been lured from California to other states.
Speaker 4: Louisiana being a key state that has been stealing our our jobs, our film production. In 2009, the state legislature passed the California Film and Television Tax Credit Program to promote film production and create and retain jobs in California.
Speaker 4: Tonight, we ask that you support a rebooting and revamping of that effort by supporting AB 1839. California's current incentive program is one of the smaller programs nationally, and expanding it will allow for more jobs and tax revenue to be created in California and actually in Long Beach, because we are a very film friendly city and consider it
Speaker 4: our job to act as a partner with our region to keep the film industry in California, tax revenue generated from filming helps to pay for teachers, police officers and infrastructure throughout the state. So Council, I'll make a motion that we weigh in in support of AB 1839 to keep quality jobs in California.
Speaker 10: So second.
Speaker 9: There's been a motion and a second, any public comment on the item, please?
Speaker 5: Patrick Kelly, Teamsters Local 952 Joint Council 42. We strongly urge support of this. I think most of you saw the article in the L.A. Times the other day that 16,000 jobs have been lost in California alone over the last several years.
Speaker 5: New York State is providing between 400 and $500 million in film credits to basically raid California. So whatever you can do to encourage and keep film production here is great. Thank you.
Speaker 9: Councilmember Neill, did you have a comment? Okay. There's a motion on the floor and the other public comment. Who made the second councilman. Okay, great. All right, so let's go and take a vote.
Speaker 1: Councilmember Andrews, please. Councilor Dylan. Motion carry symbol? Yes.

Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading Citywide.
Speaker 5: Mr. City Managers or staff report on this item.
Speaker 1: Madam Vice Mayor, members of the City Council. This item first appeared before you this summer, where the staff presented two recommendations to the City Council. One was recommendation A and one was recommendation B. The City Council chose a recommendation C, which was a combination of both of them.
Speaker 1: This allows the city staff to process a request for landmarking a piece of property without the owner's signature on the application. But it does require us to consult with the owner prior to the public hearing. So we we agree it's a great compromise.
Speaker 1: It allows for the protection of potential resources, but it also allows for owner participation at the appropriate time.
Speaker 5: Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Councilman Gonzalez.
Speaker 4: I just wanted to say thank you for the work. I'm glad we're we're moving forward with this.

Speaker 3: And this will be a very important East-West corner corridor. Excuse me to partner with this street bike boulevard that was recently completed. The 15th Street Bike Boulevard represents roughly 3.5 miles of bicycle networks, including roundabouts, different traffic, calming measures and bicycle features that will help provide safe travel along our corridors and a safe alternative to Anaheim.

"Speaker 4: Every part of the public assets and Native Communities committees. Agenda Item one Constable 119964 relating to the sale department authorizing the Sale Center Director to execute the Third Amendment to the facility. Use and Occupancy Agreement between the City of Seattle and the sale of Repertory Theory Theater.
Speaker 4: The committee recommends the City Council.
Speaker 1: Pass the bill.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Suarez, as chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to provide the committee report.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So the Seattle Repertory Theater, like the rest of Seattle's arts community is facing, has faced severe economic challenges as they will be unable to hold in-person performances until the governor's restrictions are lifted to address the challenges caused by the pandemic.
Speaker 2: This proposed Third Amendment to the 1996 agreement would remove the obligation for the Seattle Repertory Theater to make their 2019 and 2020 fiscal year contributions to the fund. The 2019 Fund is 170,000 $571,000. And that 220,000. Fiscal year contribution is 174 836,000.
Speaker 2: So since they're not since they're unable to make that contribution to the fund, we want to move to make sure that we can allow them to use the fund for operating expenses through July through June, I'm sorry, 30th, 2022.
Speaker 2: I will clarify why 2019 is listed. While COVID struck beginning of 2020. The 2019 fiscal year contributions to the fund were due June 2020. But because of the pandemic, the schedule was not met. So basically the obligation for the Seattle Repertory Theater to make these donation.
Speaker 2: I'm not donations. These contributions couldn't be done in light of COVID. The SEAL Repertory Theater would be required to maintain a minimum balance of $160,000 in the fund. The fund, which is owned and managed by the Seattle Repertory Theater and per the 1996 agreement was to have been used solely for replacement, maintenance and repair purposes of the
Speaker 2: Bagley Rite Theater. The Salem Repertory Theater was founded in 1963 under the leadership of Bagley. Right. It is one of the oldest resident organizations on the Seattle Center campus. So the after our committee hearing last week, the Public Assets and Native Keys Committee would recommend that council pass council bill 119964.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Governor Juarez. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Oh, there we go. Yes. Memorable, please.
Speaker 4: Thank you so much. I just want to express my thanks and appreciation, as I did in Committee to Seattle Center for working to address the dire needs of our arts organizations in this really difficult time and really appreciate sort of understanding that the the efforts of the city to to meet those needs will not have a negative
Speaker 4: impact on the ability of the theater to address maintenance needs, but will put the theater on better footing for when they are aiming to reopen. So thanks to Director Dellums for.
Speaker 1: His and his staff's work on this.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, are there any other comments on the bill? All right. Hearing none. Will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?
Speaker 1: PETERSON Yes. Strauss. Yes. Suarez I. HERBOLD Yes.
Speaker 3: Lewis Yes.
Speaker 1: Morales Yes. Macheda i president gonzalez. I h in favor and unopposed.

Speaker 4: Agenda item two. Constable 1199746 relating to Seattle Parks and Recreation authorizing the Superintendent of Parks Recreation to execute an amendment to the amended and restated concession agreement with Tennis Center at seven Point LLC at Warren G. Mechanism Park.
"
"Speaker 2: Please report the full council agenda item to Resolution 316 59 revising certain general rules and procedures of the Seattle City Council. Amending Chapter one a Resolution 316 39, Section 11 point D.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much. And this resolution and I'm going to move to a minute. In a moment, I'll introduce it. First is a resolution to change some fairly simple rules in the city hall in terms of court decorum.
Speaker 0: They're pretty common sensical. And I'll just sort of walk you through it, as I did this morning for those following the issue. We wanted to make the rules very clear that anyone just attempting to delay the public comment period by absolutely doing nothing but staring at us for blowing their nose or being silent without any discernible message
Speaker 0: that that is according to the law, can be construed as disruptive. And so that's not an encouraged or acceptable conduct here. We also want to make sure that any individual that or preventing another person from commenting by telling them to get out of their seat or any way intimidating them is also not acceptable according to our rules
Speaker 0: . We want to make sure that, again, another section that warnings can be given, but based on prior conduct as well, we can give a warning based on the prior conduct and by that we mean earlier in the week or just a pattern of behavior can be the basis for a warning.
Speaker 0: And then the other change is that we would like if if in fact, first of all, let me back up through the the formal rules allowed for the both the council president or the chair of the committee to give the warning or impose a sanction.
Speaker 0: This change allows any council member in any capacity participating in that meeting to be able to exercise that same authority. And then if in fact, the person wants to appeal, that they will do that at the next regularly scheduled full council meeting.
Speaker 0: Again, these have been approved by law and they think we think that it makes sense without offending anyone's right to free speech or constitutional speech and all of the liberties that we want to protect. I want to make a.
Speaker 0: An amendment to it just because we can do it at the committee. Describe what that amendment amendment is. It's basically the last part that I talked about, the appeal process being to the full council. Central staff pointed out that the prior rules allowed an appeal to the next committee.
Speaker 0: So there might have been an exclusion of the Parks Committee and the person appeals to the Transportation Committee. So we didn't think that made sense. We wanted to clean that up, and that's what the amendment is about. So first, I would like to move to amend Resolution 31659, which is the resolution just read Section 1d6 by substituting
Speaker 0: subsection six with a proposed language amended language provided on the agenda. And again, that's the appeal parts. They're second okay. Those in favor of the amendment please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The motion carries and the amendment passes.
Speaker 0: Another portion I do want to point out to my colleagues is unfortunately and this is the kind of rule that we've initiated or I've initiated that somewhat, one could argue, restricts free speech. To some extent. What we're more interested in is encouraging free speech and encouraging people that don't have the ability to come down here at 2:00
Speaker 0: or during our committee. So we're going to do some more work on how we can encourage and get more public comment. These rules are really designed to make sure anyone down here that comes are not intimidated by some of the craziness that you see, some of the hate speech that I see coming down here.
Speaker 0: That to me is quite disgusting. So we're going to do more work on trying to encourage free speech, and I thank you for their support on this resolution. Are there any further comments? Okay. I move to adopt resolution 31659 as amended their second.
Speaker 0: Any more comments? Those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended? Vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries the resolutions adopted as amended, and the chair will sign it. Thank you. Report of the Sustainability and Transportation Committee.
"
"Speaker 1: So, Madam Clerk, will you please read item into the record? Report of the Land Use Committee agenda item for a quick file. 314441 application of Wallace Properties Park at Northgate LLC for a contract result of a site located at 10735 Roosevelt, way northeast.
Speaker 1: The committee recommends that the court file be granted as conditions. Ben Clark My understanding is that I just hand it over to Councilmember Strauss. I don't move it. There's nothing to move the clock file. I believe so. Amelia, can you confirm, please?
Speaker 2: That's correct. Council President Flores. Council members also provide the committee report on the recommendations of the committee.
Speaker 1: Okay, great. Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Capps President Clerk File 31441. As you mention, is the application for a contract breakdown of 10735 was about waive work fees from our 3m2pmr. With that one suffix. This is an application for a contract free zone of two parcels located at 10735 and 10713 Roosevelt way northeast of the 55 the North Cape Urban Center from
Speaker 0: low rise three with a mandatory housing affordability designation to mid-rise with a higher two one mandatory housing affordability designation. The two parcels are adjacent to the natural area on Thornton Creek, which includes an environmentally critical multiple environmentally critical areas.
Speaker 0: The sites are about 5.5 acres in total. Unlike most contract rezoning applications we see, this application does not include a concurrent master use permit application. We did see this once before in the last few months with another location of 3050 Northeast Fire Recall correctly.
Speaker 0: This means that future development of the site will still require a master use permit application and all of the associated reviews at best. There was one appeal filed to the CPD decision for its application, which was dismissed by the hearing examiner.
Speaker 0: The hearing examiner recommended approval of the application with several conditions which are contained in the court file. One condition was that the developer assigned an environmentally critical area covenant restricting the future development within the riparian management area on site.
Speaker 0: As you heard me mentioned yesterday, I would only bring this contract zone forward if that agreement had been finalized. And Kettl Freeman of Council Central Staff has confirmed we received the signed and finalized agreement, which should be which is reflected in the register and is sent out to all legislative to all council members earlier today.
Speaker 0: Additional conditions recommended by the hearing examiner include that the future development will comply with the MHRA with MHRA by building affordable units on site, and that future development on the north site will provide a pedestrian connection, a public pedestrian connection between Roosevelt Way and Eighth Avenue.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Council president, that is the committee report on the Clarke file. Up next will be the council bill that is associated and that is the item which I believe you have to be.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you for that, Councilmember Strauss. Before we get to item number five, so with item number four in the clock file, are there any comments for Councilmember Strauss? All right. Not seeing any. Will the clerk please call the rule on granting the clerk file as conditions are as explained by Councilmember Strauss.

"
"Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. This is an appointment to the Board of Ethics. The City Council makes several appointments to the board, as does the mayor's office. And this is the board that interprets the code of ethics. We don't often have folks that we appoint to boards and commissions present in the chambers, but we do tonight.
Speaker 7: So I just wanted to acknowledge the presidents of our appointee, Ms.. Julia Jaquez, who's here in the audience today. And for the purposes of my council colleagues, I wanted to just let you know that we were not clear about this in committee, but this appointment is to fill the remaining portion of the term that was scheduled for
Speaker 7: Brian Spano, our former appointee who resigned. And so this appointment will be to finish that term through May of 2017. And to clarify that, since that was New Science Committee. And with that, I just want to thank Ms..
Speaker 7: Jaquez and as this is part of the consent agenda, to encourage us all to be supportive, but to thank her for her time and service.
Speaker 0: Thank you and welcome to City Council Chambers. And for those in the public council mechanics over the Finance and Governance Committee, which the Ethics Board reports to. And so that is why she is leading that. Okay. Thank you.
"
"Speaker 3: Agenda Item eight Council Bill 118761. An Ordinance relating to a Public Safety Bill of Rights for the Seattle public. Remembering Subchapter Six as Subchapter Five and creating a new subchapter six. In Chapter 3.28 of the Seattle Municipal Code, the committee recommends a bill passed as amended.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbal.
Speaker 3: Thank you. The Observer Bill of Rights passed out of Committee four zero week before last, and I introduced it. We heard it first, last in August, and there was a lot of work that needed to be done between our first hearing of the bill and our committee vote a week before last.
Speaker 3: But in a nutshell, the bill was introduced in recognition that observation of police activity has always been an important element of police accountability. Here in Seattle, Mothers for Account Mothers for Accountability has for decades trained community observers to watch the actions of police in detaining suspects.
Speaker 3: The majority of police interactions with the public are fair and professional, but the observation of police actions is just one way to reduce the chances that people are treated unfairly in their interactions with police. And, you know, when people are not treated fairly or force is used inappropriately, observation ensures that there's a witness today.
Speaker 3: Actual recording of observed police activity is an element of accountability that is growing in importance. The bill itself would establish that by law, the public has the right to observe police activity consistent with existing police department policy. It states that officers may not use physical force to punish or retaliate against observers and must seek to minimize harm
Speaker 3: to bystanders when using less lethal tools like pepper spray or tear gas. In addition, if a person brings a claim the law was violated, the Office of Professional Accountability must be notified. Across the country, recordings of police activity by the police have increased the public's ability to hold police accountable.
Speaker 3: However, sometimes this has led to arrests, which have in turn have generated First Amendment legal challenges to these arrests. Here in Seattle, the auditor in 2008 reviewed police incidents where people were arrested and charged with obstruction only and without any other charge.
Speaker 3: Resulting one third of the cases involved arrests of bystanders, and over half of these were African-American. That that study in 2008 was when I first became interested in this issue subsequently two that the Washington State Supreme Court recognized the First Amendment right of the public to observe and criticize law enforcement in the case of the state of
Speaker 3: Washington versus E.J. in Seattle. In the case Seattle officers had responded to a call about a fight between the complainant, sister and mother. There was a heated verbal exchange between the officers, and.
Speaker 6: E.J. refused to leave the.
Speaker 3: Open doorway of the house and closed the door because he was observing the interaction. He was a 17 year old black man. He was arrested for obstructing a law enforcement officer. Laws like this have been passed in other states, including California, Oregon and Colorado.
Speaker 3: And at a time when we have an increasing reliance on cameras that police officers wear or have in their cars, I believe we need to remind the public that the police activity that they observe is still important. A Washington Post article from March noted that in a shooting of an A in a shooting in Albuquerque, there were
Speaker 3: seven body cameras present. The camera of the police officer who fired the shot. Was it recording three missed the crucial moment and three were either blurred or contained. No record. So in this time of moving towards more reliance on police worn cameras, I think the public statement that the the observations of members of the public in the
Speaker 3: recordings of the members of public are not only important to police accountability, but the rights of individuals engaging in in that activity will be observed.
Speaker 1: By the city of Seattle.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.
Speaker 1: Gonzales. I. Herbold, i. JOHNSON Whereas I. O'BRIEN Hi, Sergeant Bagshaw. BURGESS Hi, Aiden.
Speaker 0: Favorite unopposed bill passes and the chair will sign it. We'll now return to agenda item number one from committee resolution.
Speaker 4: Okay.
Speaker 0: The report of the Affordable Housing Neighborhoods in Finance Committee. Please read item number one short title through the first semicolon.
Speaker 3: The Report of the Affordable Housing Neighborhoods and Finance Committee Agenda Item one Council Bill 118972 An ordinance relating to city employment, commonly referred to as the first quarter 2017 Employment Ordinance. The committee recommends the bill pass.
"
"Speaker 7: Agenda item three. Resolution 31598. Affirming the human right to privacy and expressing a desire that the policies and products of the Cities Privacy Initiative be consistent with the right to privacy, as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the applicable international human rights framework.
Speaker 7: The committee recommends a resolution be adopted as amended.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Harrell.
Speaker 3: Thank you, President Burgess. So this resolution affirms the human right to privacy as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and expressed and expresses the City Council's desire that any policies or products of the Privacy Initiative be consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to Privacy.
Speaker 3: Now, let me describe a little bit about about that conceptual framework. So you know what I'm talking about. I don't assume that all of you have read the Declaration of Human Rights, quote, No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his or her privacy, family harm or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his or her honor and
Speaker 3: reputation. Everyone has a right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. And the reason why this policy work becomes critically important is because, you know, we as a as a city come into contact with a lot of personal information through our surveillance, through the bills that you pay, through your interface with the city
Speaker 3: . And how we treat that information on our private citizens becomes critically important. And we formed an internal departmental team on looking at what we do with this information. So we thought as a committee and as a council that it was prudent to look at the universal laws, the declarations.
Speaker 3: The policy statement said, in fact, this country has adopted to be the sort of the framework on how we move forward. A little background on what we're trying to do with privacy. In 2012, we adopted Resolution 31420, which proclaims the Seattle to be a human rights city.
Speaker 3: And we endorsed human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You should know that many major cities in this country have not adopted this. We are one of these cities that have adopted this. In 2014, we began a privacy initiative, and this is intended to strengthen the city's privacy practice and again, in how we treat
Speaker 3: your sensitive and personal and private information. In February of 2015, we passed Resolution 31570, adopting six privacy principles, guiding the actions that the city will take when collecting and using information from the public. And on August 2015, in the future, we will report back on the privacy statement, the privacy tool kit, which will establish actionable privacy standards
Speaker 3: to enable our departments to comply with our privacy principles. So to many, this becomes critically, critically important as we move forward as a city and as the advances of technology gives the government access to technology that decades ago people would not even imagine.
Speaker 3: I'd like to thank the Seattle Human Rights Commission and the Seattle Privacy Coalition. We incorporated much of their feedback into these policy statements. The committee recommends full adoption of this resolution.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments? Council members. I want to.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember her, for your comments. I support the human right to privacy and will be voting yes on this resolution to affirm that. I think we should also follow up on this resolution by taking concrete steps to actually protect the privacy of Seattleites.
Speaker 2: A couple of times a year, the council votes on supplemental budgets that accept federal money from the Department of Homeland Security and to fund so-called fusion centers in Seattle. According to new documents leaked by Edward Snowden. These fusion centers are used just to help the NSA spy on every man, woman and child in Seattle and in the
Speaker 2: country. So I will vote yes on this resolution, and I will encourage my colleagues to join me in putting this resolution into practice and voting against funding the fusion centers. The next supplemental budget. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Other comments? All in favor of adopting resolution 31598 vote. I oppose vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted and the chair will sign it. Please read item for.

Speaker 2: Relating to fair housing the committee recommends will pass as amended.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Mosquito.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate your enthusiasm to get to get to get to this agenda topic. This bill prohibits tenants and prospective and prospective tenants and landlords from using rental housing building platforms for a year. While the city determines whether those platforms are in compliance with the city's regulation and looks at the impact on the housing
Speaker 2: market and the committee recommends passage of the bill as amended.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much. Any further comments? Castro and Johnson just want.
Speaker 6: To say thanks to Councilmember Musketeer. This came to our attention from some of the folks from CWA and she really dug in on this topic, spent a lot of time and energy on it, and I'm grateful to her for her leadership on bringing this issue forward.
Speaker 6: It's going to affect many of my constituents very positively. So thank you for your leadership, Councilmember Oscar.
Speaker 0: I think for those and I share those concerns as well. I share those sentiments. Okay. Please call the roll on the passage.
Speaker 2: If I may just make a few more. Yes.
Speaker 0: Comments. Apologize for moving forward.
Speaker 2: I just want to say thanks again to my colleagues for identifying this issue. Thanks especially to Councilmember Suarez and Time Council President harrell for your work to add language to this bill. Thank you to aisha and to my staff, michael maddox, who worked on this legislation.
Speaker 2: This is one of the first pieces of legislation I've had the opportunity to bring forward today. So thank you to the council. And as Councilmember Johnson explained, this really comes directly from the community. As you do have students putting this on our radar and asking for us to have strong legislation.
Speaker 2: I think the inclusion of your amendments makes this piece of policy even better at its heart. This is really about fair housing. This is about our city's commitment to making sure that our fair housing and equitable housing is a reality for all of Seattleites.
Speaker 2: And I believe it also touches on our commitment to try to be proactive and get ahead of new platforms as they come onto the market to make sure that we're looking at any potential unintended consequences and really thinking proactively here.
Speaker 2: We have the opportunity to be proactive, to be thoughtful, and to really think about how we fold in these new technologies into our regulatory system.
Speaker 1: I think that it's clear that this.
Speaker 2: Is not yet penetrated our community yet, and I think that in working with our community at large and asking the Office of Housing and Civil Rights and Construction and Inspection to do a deep dove analysis on how these products impact our commitment to equitable housing, we'll have a better opportunity to look at long term solutions.
Speaker 2: I really think this gives us an opportunity to make those informed discussions with community at large. And thanks again to Puget Sound Stage, who you heard from today to ASU, Deb, and to the Council for your longstanding commitment to equitable housing.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.

"
"Speaker 1: Motion carries unanimously of 13. Communication from Councilman Austin. Chair State Legislation Committee Recommendation to adopt. And support position as position SB 16 bill, a state proposal that will provide a new temporary funding source for state and local, street and road projects.
Speaker 0: Council Bros.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm pleased to bring before you an item from the State Legislation Committee, which we we supported in committee and encouraged your support as well. This is this bill we believe is going to be very good for Long Beach in terms of our infrastructure, addressing our important infrastructure needs.
Speaker 3: The League of California Cities has voted unanimously to support this particular bill, that it is a priority bill working its way through the state legislature. And essentially, in a nutshell, it will provide a windfall of resources for the city of Long Beach and many other municipalities, all of the municipalities throughout the state of California, as well as
Speaker 3: funding for local highways to the tune of a $3 billion raise over a five year period to Long Beach. That means a windfall of 50 to $60 million or 10 to $12 million a year for infrastructure needs. Currently, we contribute, I think, appropriate about $5 million a year toward infrastructure needs.
Speaker 3: So if this bill is successful in Sacramento, it will mean that we more than triple our infrastructure, our ability to address infrastructure needs, and we know we have them in every district in the city. And so with that, I want to ask for a staff report for Diana Ting and obviously ask for your full support on this
Speaker 3: . I'm going to make the motion.
Speaker 0: There's a motion. Can I get a second, please? Okay. Second, but Councilwoman Gonzalez.
Speaker 2: Mayor, members of the city council, Councilmember Austin covered most of the pertinent details about SB 16. It is a five year increase in an excise tax on gasoline and diesel, as well as an increase to the vehicle registration fee.
Speaker 2: And the funding, again, will fund local streets and roads as well as the state highway system and its for Long Beach assessment shows that we invest an average of $5 million a year in this in our local streets and roads.
Speaker 2: And as the bill is written now, we would be receiving about an extra 10 to 12 million a year that we wouldn't otherwise receive.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.
Speaker 5: Thank you. I want to speak to the community a little bit about how this bill actually really levels the playing field and helps put the tax burden of infrastructure on the people who are using it the most. I am one and several other of my colleagues who drive hybrid and electric and electric vehicles.
Speaker 5: And so this transition really allows the consumers of the most use of the road to take on an additional burden by leveling the playing field through not just gasoline tax, but really the VLF on the electric and hybrid vehicles.
Speaker 5: And while I am not supportive of higher taxes, I am supportive of correcting the taxation ratios to ensure that those who use the most are the ones who pay the most. And so I'll be supporting this idea.
Speaker 0: Councilor Austin.
Speaker 3: Thank you. I call for the question.
Speaker 0: I just want to just make one note before the council votes. Council member this, in my opinion, is going to be one of the top priorities for cities across the state of California this year. Quite frankly, we as a city and a community need to put our full weight behind getting this done in Sacramento.
Speaker 0: There are a lot of bills in the pipeline and probably very few that are more important for cities, in particular Long Beach, than the bill that's in front of us today. The truth is, is every time that we look at our at the bottom line in our budget and ask why we can't do more for infrastructure, why
Speaker 0: we can't get more streets and sidewalks built, why neighborhood streets are falling apart because we don't have the resources from both both Sacramento and Washington, DC. This is an attempt by Sacramento to give us some flexibility for a set number of years to be able to go after really significant infrastructure change.
Speaker 0: And so we're I know I personally am pretty excited about this. I intend to be in Sacramento often on this as I know well, our our committee our legislative committee in Sacramento as well. So I think this is very exciting legislation.
Speaker 0: And I want to thank Senator Bill as well as our state senator, Ricardo Lora, who is very active on this bill as well on on this issue. So I look forward to us being able to get this done and see a lot of dollars come back to Long Beach.
Speaker 0: Is there any public comment on this bill? CNN. Please cast your votes.
Speaker 1: Motion passes unanimously.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Next up, item 14.
Speaker 1: Report from Financial Management. Recommendation to award a contract to Bank of America Public Capital Corporation to provide master lease services in an amount not to exceed $111 million citywide.

Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. Councilor Peterson, you're the chair of the committee and are recognized in order to provide the committee report on this item.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President This is another technical measure for utility management. This legislation council bill 119899 amends our 2009 open access transmission tariff which governs how others can transmit their electricity between points on Seattle City Lights Transmission Systems.
Speaker 2: This updated version is necessary to account for the changing business needs of the utility and address expiring contracts with other transmission users. According to this fiscal note, this legislation will have minimal to no impact on city light. It passed our committee unanimously.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those comments. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Hearing no additional comments on the bill. Will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?
