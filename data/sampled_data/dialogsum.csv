"#Person1#: Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country? 
#Person2#: There is some, but my country is not amongst the leading producers. The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country. Your country is a big oil producer, isn't it? 
#Person1#: Yes, it is. My country is famous for having that natural resources. We also have a lot of natural gas. 
#Person2#: We have some too. Do you have a lot of coal? 
#Person1#: No coal has been discovered in my country, but there may be undiscovered deposits. We don't have many metal deposits. 
#Person2#: There are a few in my country. We have deposit of gold, but they are very small. 
#Person1#: When I traveled around your country, I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country. The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country. The gold was found in mountain steams. 
#Person2#: That's right. A few people go panning for gold in rivers. 
#Person1#: You have many trees in your country. That's another natural resources. 
#Person2#: It's a natural resources that we hardly use. Government policy is to conserve those forests. 
#Person1#: I see. That's probably a good idea. Too many forest are being destroyed. 
#Person2#: Is your country's environment being damaged by the oil industry? 
#Person1#: We have some inspections, but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil. There has been some damage, but it is under control. "
"#Person1#: Excuse me, but could you tell me how to get to the railway station?
#Person2#: Yes, you'll have to take a No. 45 bus.
#Person1#: Does the bus take me straight to the station?
#Person2#: Yes, when you get off the bus, you will find the station just in front of you.
#Person1#: Good, but where is the bus stop?
#Person2#: Go straight along the road and turn right at the first crossing. You can't miss it.
#Person1#: Thank you. How soon can I get there?
#Person2#: Well, if the streets are not too crowded, you will get there in about half an hour.
#Person1#: Thank you very much.
#Person2#: You are welcome."
"#Person1#: You're watching TV again Peter.
#Person2#: I have washed all the bowls and plates.
#Person1#: But you haven't watered the flowers or fed the birds.
#Person2#: I'm sorry. I forgot, I will do it now.
#Person1#: Your dad just did that for you.
#Person2#: Oh that was really nice of him. Well mom, I turned on the TV only because I want to know the result of the game between Manchester United and Manchester City.
#Person1#: Why didn't you just search online?
#Person2#: My computer isn't working.
#Person1#: Didn't you turn it off after you finished your homework?
#Person2#: Oh that's right. I forgot. No wonder!"
"#Person1#: Hi, Angela, what's up?
#Person2#: We are planning to visit Zhang Jiakou this February. Why don't you join us?
#Person1#: Certainly, I will if I don't have anything else on my schedule.
#Person2#: Is the Spring Festival ok for you?
#Person1#: Of course, which places are you going to visit?
#Person2#: We want to visit some ski resorts in other places of interests there, you know, Zhang Jiakou is one of the whole cities for the two thousand twenty two Winter Olympic Games.
#Person1#: In that case, we should check information online and make us a thorough plan for the trip."
"#Person1#: Oh, it's a fine day, isn't it? And the food smells nice. It's a perfect day for a picnic.
#Person2#: Yes, it is. I'm glad it doesn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way.
#Person1#: Oh, hi! I'm Alice. Nice to meet you.
#Person2#: Nice to meet you too. So Alice...what do you do?
#Person1#: I'm studying medicine.
#Person2#: Really? Where?
#Person1#: At Harvard. What about you?
#Person2#: I'm working for IBM.
#Person1#: Oh, are you? That sounds interesting.
#Person2#: Yeah. I like it. Hey, it looks like the food is ready."
"#Person1#: Excuse me. What's the postage on this letter to New York, please?
#Person2#: How would you like to send it?
#Person1#: By registered airmail.
#Person2#: Eighty cents, please. And please write down the postal code in the mailing address. Anything else?
#Person1#: Yes. I'd like 6 postcards and 10 fifty-cent stamps, please.
#Person2#: All right. Here you are.
#Person1#: And this package is for London. Will you weigh it for me?
#Person2#: Yes, of course. This package is 10 grams overweight. You'll have to pay 50 cents extra for the overweight."
"#Person1#: You look a bit dull today. What's up? 
#Person2#: Well, my mum lost her job yesterday. 
#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year, with more than half being women. 
#Person2#: The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole. 
#Person1#: Yeah, it's true. What is she going to do? 
#Person2#: Well, she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community. 
#Person1#: That's not bad. It could be a short-term alternative. Your mum can look for another one when the market improves. Things will work out eventually. 
#Person2#: Thank you. I just hope she won't feel pressed. "
"#Person1#: Wow, the ferris wheel over there is so big. I'd like to take a ride on it.
#Person2#: It is called Energy Collector.
#Person1#: Look at your right-hand. Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom?
#Person2#: Maybe. Oh. I see the Jungle Flying Train. I once rode it. It was very exciting.
#Person1#: I want to have a try later.
#Person2#: Me, too. Daniel, look at your left side. Can you see the Air Force Ants?
#Person1#: Wow, that's my favorite. It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky.
#Person2#: Good, you can make your dream come true here.
#Person1#: Of course. After this, I want to show you to the Haunted House.
#Person2#: So you can prove you are a man.
#Person1#: Bingo!
#Person2#: It's just you!"
"#Person1#: Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan.
#Person2#: Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security?
#Person1#: No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations.
#Person2#: We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.
#Person1#: Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York. He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0, 000 until the end of this year.
#Person2#: Good. He is a man of high standing. I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion. But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan."
"#Person1#: I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site. You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce.
#Person2#: It depends on the time of year. At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch. We also contract out certain services all year round, for example, cleaning. We run a very tight operation!
#Person1#: Do you handle the recruiting yourselves?
#Person2#: Sometimes we use a local employment agency. It depends on the job."
"#Person1#: I want to go try on these clothes.
#Person2#: What did you find?
#Person1#: I found some jeans, and a new blouse.
#Person2#: Go and try it on.
#Person1#: What do you think?
#Person2#: I love that shirt on you.
#Person1#: What about the jeans?
#Person2#: They don't really fit you right.
#Person1#: I don't think so either.
#Person2#: That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you.
#Person1#: I'll just buy the shirt.
#Person2#: That would be a good idea."
"#Person1#: Sam, we are hard up for the everyday expenses. When can you find a job.
#Person2#: I'm looking for it, but you see, the market is hard up for jobs, too.
#Person1#: You liar, I saw you again in the inn. I bet you don't want to work at all."
"#Person1#: Hello!
#Person2#: Oh, hi!
#Person1#: Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom.
#Person2#: Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice. Did you just move in next door?
#Person1#: Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?
#Person2#: Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long?
#Person1#: No, not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice?
#Person2#: I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do?
#Person1#: I am an accountant at a company
#Person2#: Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, and I need to get to the college.
#Person1#: It's nice meeting you too, Alice.
#Person2#: See you around!
#Person1#: Goodbye, Alice."
"#Person1#: Frank and Peter want new bicycles. Petrol is very expensive, so they both want to cycle to work.
#Person2#: They're looking at advertisements.
#Person1#: What about this Curzon bike? It's very cheap. Only 80 pounds.
#Person2#: Yes, but the Anderson bike is even cheaper, 865 pounds.
#Person1#: How old is the Anderson one?
#Person2#: It's a 2006 model.
#Person1#: The Curzon is a 2008 model. It's newer."
"#Person1#: Do a lot of people do mountain running?
#Person2#: Yes, the runs take place in the countryside. The areas like the Lake District in the Highlands of Scotland are very popular. But this doesn't stop people from the city taking part. For example, I drive to my club for my city apartment.
#Person1#: Can you tell me the history of mountain running?
#Person2#: Well, there are records of people doing this going back nearly 1000 years. It was always been connected with country fairs and festivals. Overtime it became official, and nowadays a run is operated usually on its own.
#Person1#: Hmm, what are the tougher courses like?
#Person2#: There is a race called the Dragons Back, which takes place over 5 days and over a distance of 200 miles. But before you sign up for it, I should point out that only people with lots of experience are allowed to enter.
#Person1#: How can you get started in the sport?
#Person2#: Well, you start with something easy and work your way up to more challenging runs. If you want to enter races, you'll find their graded in terms of distance and height. But just as people who do road running won't necessarily run a marathon, you don't have to enter mountain running races."
"#Person1#: Well, what do you think is the reason most people do so badly at reaching goals?
#Person2#: They lose focus. Everybody's life is busy. There is so much happening in everybody's life. That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that. Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say 'oh, here are my goals' and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way. They stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them."
"#Person1#: Excuse me, is this the parcel post counter?
#Person2#: No, it's at counter 1, right over there.
#Person1#: ( At counter 1. ) Do you take parcels here?
#Person2#: Yes.
#Person1#: I want to send this package to Los Angeles, please.
#Person2#: Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail?
#Person1#: I'd like to send it by regular mail.
#Person2#: I'll have to weigh it first. 120 yuan, please.
#Person1#: Here is 200.
#Person2#: Your change, please.
#Person1#: Thank you."
"#Person1#: Anna, come in, please.
#Person2#: Yes, Mr. Green. What would you like me to do?
#Person1#: I need a bus ticket to Seattle.
#Person2#: What time do you want to leave, Mr. Green?
#Person1#: Well, tomorrow morning, as early as I can. I have an appointment before noon.
#Person2#: There's a bus every thirty minutes starting at 5:30 a.m.
#Person1#: In that ease, I'd like to leave then. Wait... My wife's going to drop me off here on her way to work. Could you book me a 6:30 ticket instead?
#Person2#: Sure. Will it be one way or round-trip?
#Person1#: Oh, I probably should buy a round-trip ticket now, since I'll be coming back tomorrow evening. Oh, is there a bus around 6?
#Person2#: Yes, there's one at 5:45. You'd get back before 8 o'clock?
#Person1#: OK, I'll take that one. I told my wife we'd see a movie at 9:30."
"#Person1#: Can you lift the toilet seat up when you go to the bathroom, please? I hate having to clean up after you all the time.
#Person2#: Sorry about that. While we're on the topic, there are a few things you do that had been annoying me lately.
#Person1#: Oh, really?
#Person2#: Yeah, like when you leave the laundry in the washing machine, it makes the clothes smell bad.
#Person1#: I'm sorry. I'm just busy doing all the chores around the house, since you're clearly too busy to do any of them yourself.
#Person2#: Look, I didn't want to get into a fight. But you started it.
#Person1#: Oh, honey, I'm sorry if I was rude.
#Person2#: No, you're right. I need to start lending more of a hand around here."
"#Person1#: Hey. Uh, you look really unhappy. What's going on?
#Person2#: Ah, you don't want to know.
#Person1#: Okay, see ya.
#Person2#: Wait, wait, wait! Why are you walking away?
#Person1#: Well, you said I didn't want to know.
#Person2#: No, wait. You see my parents really don't love me.
#Person1#: What do you mean? When I met them last week, they seemed really caring.
#Person2#: Uh, you don't understand! You see. I want a new smart phone ... I mean, I need one, and my parents won't buy me it!
#Person1#: Uh, excuse me, but uh, don't you already have a iPhone?
#Person2#: Man, yeah, but it's three months old, and it has a small scratch on it.
#Person1#: Where? Let me see. [Look!] I don't see a scratch.
#Person2#: Look, look right here!. [THAT?] [Do] you see it?
#Person1#: It's just a speck of dust.
#Person2#: Anyway. And my other phone ...
#Person1#: What? You have two phones?
#Person2#: That's beside the point.
#Person1#: So, so, did your parents give you a reason for not buying you a new phone?
#Person2#: Not a good one. Only something about being self-reliant and not being so entitled, or something like that. And now they want me to work ... on the neighbor's farm to pay for it. [Good idea!] It's not fair.
#Person1#: Hey, I think I know the problem. [What?] Take a look in the mirror. You'll see both the problem and the solution.
#Person2#: Uh! You're no help."
"#Person1#: Good morning, Star Airline. What can I do for you?
#Person2#: I'd like to confirm a reservation, please. My name is Wang Lin. My flight is KF98.
#Person1#: I see. You are leaving for Berlin on July 23rd with Mr. Smith, right?
#Person2#: What? I am afraid you have made a mistake, I am leaving on July 21st alone.
#Person1#: Isn't your family name Lin?
#Person2#: No. It is Wang.
#Person1#: I am sonry. So you are loaving on Duty 21st and your seat is in the business section.
#Person2#: That's right. Thank you."
"#Person1#: Have you anything to declare?
#Person2#: One bottle of perfume and a watch.
#Person1#: Where did you buy it?
#Person2#: In Boston.
#Person1#: Do you travel a lot?
#Person2#: Oh. . . I go to see my sister twice a year or so.
#Person1#: Twice a year? How long has your sister lived in Boston?
#Person2#: Nearly ten years.
#Person1#: I see, that's a long time. How much was the watch?
#Person2#: I can't remember, but I've got the receipt somewhere. Would you like to see it?
#Person1#: Yes, I'd like to see the receipt. Oh! I see you bought the watch last week.
#Person2#: Yes. Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it?
#Person1#: Yes, I'm afraid you will. Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds.
#Person2#: Ok. Here you are. Is that all right now?
#Person1#: Yes, that's fine. I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston?
#Person2#: Yes, I did. I had a fine time."
"#Person1#: Hello, I want to know how much it costs to have a manicure and pedicure.
#Person2#: Usually it's 60 dollars for a manicure, and 80 dollars for a pedicure. But with this special discount, the total for both is only one hundred and 20 dollars, and you can get them painted.
#Person1#: That's nice. I'd like to give it a try. I think I like passion red. please.
#Person2#: Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut, too?
#Person1#: No.
#Person2#: Would you like the shapes square or round?

"#Person1#: Excuse me , can I use your computer to type my paper? 
#Person2#: No problem.

#Person2#: Oh, Never mind, I finished my paper. So you can use it tonight . 
#Person1#: Thanks a lot! "
"#Person1#: Hello.
#Person2#: Hi, my name is Kelsey Adams. I'm calling about the TV.
#Person1#: Oh, hi. So you saw my ad in the newspaper?
#Person2#: That's right. My old TV just stopped working, so I think this might be great for both of us.
#Person1#: I hope so. It's a 50 inch Sony flat screen TV and it's only 6 months old. I'm asking for $500. But I'd be willing to negotiate.
#Person2#: It sounds like a decent deal, but I would have to see at first of course.
#Person1#: Absolutely. When can you come over to take a look at it?
#Person2#: How about 3:00 PM this afternoon?
#Person1#: Hmm... I've got a meeting at 2:00 PM and it might run a little late. How does 4:00 PM sound?
#Person2#: Perfect, just tell me your address."
"#Person1#: Well, that was an interesting documentary!
#Person2#: For sure! I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.
#Person1#: Like what?
#Person2#: Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?
#Person1#: Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement. Through a 401K, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.
#Person2#: That's interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.
#Person1#: That seems a bit unstable don't you think?
#Person2#: Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.
#Person1#: I'Ve been thinking of doing that lately! I don't want some banker to run off with my money!"
"#Person1#: Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing?
#Person2#: How regular?
#Person1#: An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey, the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that.
#Person2#: You are kidding me? It is against the labor law. They should be aware of their rights.
#Person1#: But these people say nothing about that. They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days.
#Person2#: That's not right, somebody should do something."
"#Person1#: Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK?
#Person2#: I don't know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.
#Person1#: Come on. We'Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it.
#Person2#: I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.
#Person1#: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.
#Person2#: I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.
#Person1#: OK. how does this sound. let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!
#Person2#: You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my wingman for tonight?
#Person1#: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys'night out. . . well kinda. . .
#Person2#: Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it's not a pretty picture!"
"#Person1#: (Sniffing) Phew! Is that French coffee?
#Person2#: Pardon?
#Person1#: Is that French coffee you are drinking?
#Person2#: Yes,that's right. Why? What's the matter?
#Person1#: I don't understand why you drink French coffee. It makes a strong smell.
#Person2#: I like it very much, I prefer it to English coffee.
#Person1#: Have you got a lot of it?
#Person2#: Yes. Why?
#Person1#: Well.., er...could I get some from you?
#Person2#: Get some from me? But...you don't like French coffee!
#Person1#: No, I don't, but my wife does and I can't understand why."
"#Person1#: Good afternoon, you look a little stuck. Can I help?
#Person2#: The thing is, I've got all of this information here, all of these leaflets, but I can't make head nor tail of them!
#Person1#: I see. What is it exactly that you are interested in?
#Person2#: I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit.
#Person1#: Well, that all depends on how much you want to invest.
#Person2#: I was thinking of around 10, 000 RIB.
#Person1#: That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94. 35 RIB.
#Person2#: And for the Savings Deposit?
#Person1#: For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more. You see, in time deposit, the interest rate is 1. 58 % after the 20 % interest tax. So, technically you could get more than a third more.
#Person2#: Wow! A third more? Very good."
"#Person1#: Maths department, Doctor Webster speaking.
#Person2#: Hello, Professor Webster, this is Janet Wang calling. I'm living two doors down from your teaching assistant, Ken Williams. Ken asked me to call you because he has lost his voice and can't talk to you himself.
#Person1#: Lost his voice? Oh, what a shame! Is there anything I can do for you?
#Person2#: Well, Ken has a class this afternoon from two-thirty to four and he won't be able to teach it, but he doesn't want to cancel it either.
#Person1#: Want me to try to find somebody else to teach the class?
#Person2#: No, not exactly. What he wants to do is to get someone to go in for him, just to pass back the midterm exams. He's already marked them and they are on the desk in his office. The whole thing wouldn't take more than ten minutes.
#Person1#: His classes are two-thirty, eh? Well, I'm afraid at that time I'll be on campus anyway; so I can do it for him.
#Person2#: Thank you very much, Professor Webster."

#Person2#: Wow! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards.
#Person1#: I know you love the Oscars. This game has some great questions about all types of movies.

#Person1#: Yes. In fact, one of the categories is on foreign language films."
"#Person1#: Good morning.

#Person1#: What's your relationship with the victim?

#Person1#: How many times did you stab the victim?
#Person2#: I stabbed his belly three times.
#Person1#: Did you know that your actions might cause serous injuries or death?

"#Person1#: You're always working around the house on Saturday, painting and doing repairs. You must enjoy it.
#Person2#: Not really. I'd rather relax or go fishing, but Saturday is the only day I have to get anything done. By the time I get home from work during the week, I'm too tired."

#Person2#: Oh, Michael, I'm so proud of you, you're a very accomplished young man. Do you know where you want to go to college?
#Person1#: I really want to go to the University of Southern California, but they might not let me in. It's a very good school and it's very difficult to be accepted there.
#Person2#: Well, I'm sure they will take you, honey. You're a special young man. You've really made your grandfather and me so proud."
"#Person1#: Hi, professor Smith.

#Person1#: I am OK, but I'm doing badly in your class. I am wondering how to do better.
#Person2#: I think comeing prepared class may do something to improve your grades.
#Person1#: How can I prepare for class?
#Person2#: Have you checked out my web page? All of my lecture notes are on my web page. You can download the notes and read them ahead of time.
#Person1#: Really? Wow, that would be very helpful.
#Person2#: Another good idea is to read each chapter in the book before class.
#Person1#: I usually don't read the chapter ahead of time. I thought hearing the lecture first was better than reading first.
#Person2#: Reading first is actually better. You should also write down ideas or notes while you're reading. That way, you can come to class with some questions."
"#Person1#: How did you enjoy your family party at ' ginger's '? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet.
#Person2#: Oh, it was great. We had seafood buffet. They do one every Friday. The waiters and waitresses are very good. They are very attentive, but don't hang around the table.
#Person1#: I like the buffets they have, but if often order a la carte, because I don't feel extremely hungry. I like the wine list there too.
#Person2#: Yes, so do I. they have wines from all over the world. There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket. We ordered some Australian red wine, which tasted delicious and wasn't expensive.
#Person1#: Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, but the don't do that at ' ginger's '. what was included in the seafood buffet?
#Person2#: They had almost every kind of seafood. There were oyster, shrimp, prawns, crabs, and fish. I ate a lot of smoked salmon.
#Person1#: Did they have lobster?
#Person2#: No, they didn't. you could order it from the menu. I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet.
#Person1#: Yes, it probably is. I don't like ordering oysters in restaurants. You never know whether they are fresh.
#Person2#: I know. I didn't eat any, but a few people in our group did and no one got sick.
#Person1#: When you eat out, do you usually eat from the buffet?
#Person2#: Not usually. I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I'm still hungry afterwards.
#Person1#: Oh, you don't usually have a starter?
#Person2#: No, I might have a soup if it's a cold winter day."
"#Person1#: Good morning. I'm from the new york book review. Could I ask you some question about your latest book?
#Person2#: Sure. Take a seat. . . what would you like to know?
#Person1#: First, I'Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story.
#Person2#: That's correct. It's a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago. The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case.
#Person1#: How do you research your books?
#Person2#: I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most charact
#Person1#: I really like your books. I'Ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again!
#Person2#: Thank you. Let met sign it for you. . . there you go.
#Person1#: Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about?
#Person2#: There's a real mix of stories in the book. I haven't finished all of them yet, though. Many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your

"#Person1#: May I help you?
#Person2#: Yes. I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation.
#Person1#: How long do you have?
#Person2#: 1 week. Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there?
#Person1#: New York is full of place of interest, such as Times Square, Broadway, Wall street and Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty.
#Person2#: That's fantastic."
"#Person1#: Let's go to the animal shelter.
#Person2#: What do you want to do?
#Person1#: I want to get a puppy for my son.
#Person2#: That will make him so happy.
#Person1#: I'll get him one of those little dogs.
#Person2#: One that won't grow up too big.
#Person1#: And eat too much.
#Person2#: Do you know which one he would like?
#Person1#: Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.
#Person2#: I bet you had to drag him away.
#Person1#: He wanted to take it home yesterday.
#Person2#: I wonder what he'll name it."
"#Person1#: When I say I live in Sweden, people always want to know about the seasons.
#Person2#: The seasons?
#Person1#: Yeah, you know how cold it is in winter? What is it like when the days are so short?
#Person2#: So what is it like?
#Person1#: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter. Sometimes it is cold as 26 degrees below centigrade. And of course when you go out, you'll wrap up warm. But inside in the houses it's always very warm, much warmer than at home. Swedish people always complain that when they visit England, the houses are cold even in the good winter.
#Person2#: And what about the darkness?
#Person1#: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there's only one hour of daylight, so you really looks forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing, from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It's still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.
#Person2#: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun.
#Person1#: Yeah, that's right, but it's wonderful. You won't stay up all night. And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. They'd like to work hard, but play hard, too. I think Londoners work longer hours, but I'm not sure this is a good thing."

"#Person1#: I lost my dog. Can you help me look for him?
#Person2#: Yes, of course. When was the last time you saw him?
#Person1#: I tide him up right here as I went to grab some coffee. When I came back outside, he was gone.
#Person2#: OK, what does he look like?
#Person1#: He's white with black spots He's around 40 pounds and has short hair. His name is Milo and he always comes when he's called.
#Person2#: I'll take the streets going to the right and you take the streets going to the left. Meet me back in front of the coffee shop in 10 minutes. If we don't find him, we can take my car to look farther out.
#Person1#: Do you think I should call the police?
#Person2#: I doubt if they'll have time to help, but I don't think will need them. Look over there in that Park 2 blocks down.

#Person2#: I got rid of that clunker. This is my new one. 
#Person1#: Is that right? It sure beats the old one? 
#Person2#: Jump in, I'll give you a ride. 
#Person1#: Ok. Boy, this looks expensive. 
#Person2#: Yeah, it costed a bundle alright. 
#Person1#: Wow, this's sinking a hole.

"#Person1#: I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning. 
#Person2#: Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue. 
#Person1#: So did I. that's why I didn't take my umbrella. I got cold in the rain in the afternoon. It was raining cats and dogs. 
#Person2#: I know. I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm. It was pouring with rain all afternoon. 
#Person1#: We really have some mysable weather sometime. I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round. 
#Person2#: If it was sunning all year round there would be drought. You probably would not like it either. 
#Person1#: I guess you are right. Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable. 
#Person2#: The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like. Our weather is so changeable. "

"#Person1#: What reasons do westerners drink for?
#Person2#: I don't think drinking requires any special purposes. For us people in the West, the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine.
#Person1#: I know what you mean there. In many circumstances, people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake. And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet. Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines, like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine, alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself. We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere, improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship.
#Person2#: And to make matters worse, you're urged to drink ' one more cup time and again. There is too much etiquette to observe. You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine, its color, its aroma and its delicate taste.
#Person1#: Yeah. It's of supreme importance that the goblet, table-cloth, and plates should be made shiningly clean, so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable.
#Person2#: Yes. For me, who can't hold much liquor, it's particularly agreeable. If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet!"
"#Person1#: Hello! Can I help you?

#Person1#: What kind of flowers do you want?
#Person2#: I have no idea.

#Person2#: But rose is too common.
#Person1#: Well, what about violet? It means the eternal beauty.
#Person2#: It looks good. Pack me a bouquet of violet, please."
"#Person1#: Excuse me, I'd like to buy a guitar. Could you recommend one?
#Person2#: Sure. Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one?
#Person1#: An acoustic one.
#Person2#: Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical?
#Person1#: What's the difference?
#Person2#: Well, a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar's. It's best suited for finger picking. A steel-string is best for playing chords.
#Person1#: I'm mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar.
#Person2#: In that case, I'd suggest a steel-string guitar. The best one we have is the Ovation.
#Person1#: This one's a little too expensive for me. I'd prefer something cheaper for now. When I'Ve learned to play, I might get a better one.
#Person2#: In that case, how about this one? It's inexpensive but it's still well made and easy to play.
#Person1#: Hmm. All right, I'll take it, and this book on how to play the guitar as well.
#Person2#: You should also get a couple of guitar picks.
#Person1#: Oh, right. Thanks for your help.
#Person2#: Don't mention it."
"#Person1#: Good evening. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the robbery.
#Person2#: Of course, officer. Come in.
#Person1#: Tell me what happened.
#Person2#: Well, last night I left work early. When I reached home, I saw that the lights were on in the library.
#Person1#: What did you do then?
#Person2#: I went and looked in the library window and I saw a man.
#Person1#: What did he look like?
#Person2#: Well, he was tall and he had red hair.
#Person1#: Did he see you?
#Person2#: Yes, he did. He ran out of the room and I went to call the police."
"#Person1#: Excuse me, do you have a vacancy?
#Person2#: Let me see. Yes, we still have four left.
#Person1#: Well, I would like to book a single room.
#Person2#: How long would you stay?
#Person1#: 5 days. From Feb. 13 to 18."
"#Person1#: Why did you decide to publicize climate change in this way?
#Person2#: Well, I was really upset about some countries failure to sign up pollution control agreements. It felt like the science wasn't getting understood by the politicians, so I decided to look into what I personally could do, that led me to dream up a cartoon character called Mr. Carbon. We all know somebody like him, he's climate ignorant and makes no effort to save energy. Of course, factories are the obvious bad character in the real world, but I couldn't do much about them.
#Person1#: So, are we going to see him in scenes like we get in disaster movies?
#Person2#: That's pretty unlikely, it's hard to make a box office success. But he certainly gives cause for concern. People are becoming more aware of the climate change.
#Person1#: So you came up with the idea of another cartoon character, Mrs. Green.
#Person2#: Yes, now, she pays attention to little things, uses low energy light bulbs doesn't leave the TV on standby. Goes in for recycling. As well as making a contribution to the climate, she'll save $150,000 over her lifetime."
"#Person1#: In Britain, we are often told that people are leaving the big cities to live in the countryside, but is this the same worldwide?
#Person2#: Not at all. If you look at the biggest cities in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, 7 out of the top 10 were in the developed countries. But by the year two thousand, the developing countries will have 8 out of top 10. New York, which in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, was number one with a population of around 12,000,000 will only be the sixth the largest city in the world, but with an extra 2 million.
#Person1#: And London?
#Person2#: London, which was number 2, won't even be in the top ten, its population in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, by the way, was about 10,000,000.
#Person1#: And why is this happening? Why are people moving to the big cities from the country in the developing countries?
#Person2#: The reasons are various, but many are moving to look for work and the problems caused by this are enormous. It said the 26,000,000 people will be living in Mexico City by the year two thousand, with Sao Paulo in Brazil, not far behind.
#Person1#: It's hard to believe.
#Person2#: I know. Well, just imagine the difficulties this is going to cause in terms of health, transport, an education."
"#Person1#: Excuse me, I'm looking for some English textbooks.
#Person2#: They're right over there under the dictionaries on the second shelf from the top.
#Person1#: Do you have any textbooks to help improve students reading skills?
#Person2#: Let's see. These books here focus on grammar and those are mainly for conversation practice. Here you are. This book has short passages for students to read an answer questions about.
#Person1#: Great. That is just the sort of thing that I'm looking for. Thanks a lot.

#Person1#: Well, I think I can give you a hand if you want. I can go shopping with you tomorrow morning.
#Person2#: Wow, that's very kind of you, in that case, I will have enough time to do housework for my mother. Then I can watch the game in the afternoon. By the way, when will the game begin?
#Person1#: At 2:00 PM. I will pick you up at 1:30 PM.

"#Person1#: Hi, Iris, what are you still doing here? I thought you were working a half day, so you could prepare for your trip to the beach.
#Person2#: That was my plan, but the weather report is calling for rain this weekend. It supposed to be nicer next weekend.
#Person1#: So will you go next weekend instead?
#Person2#: Yeah. I think I'll stay at home this weekend and work a half day next Friday. I'd rather go when the weather is better."

"#Person1#: The children have been playing in the mountains for a long time. Why haven't they come back? I am really worried about them.
#Person2#: Look at the sky. Black clouds are gathering and strong winds are blowing. It seems a heavy rain will fall soon.
#Person1#: They haven't brought anything to protect themselves. They will be caught in the rain I think.
#Person2#: Don't be worried too much about them. Anyhow, they're old enough now. They ought to be able to take care of themselves.
#Person1#: I'm afraid they will catch a cold if they are caught in the rain. You see it's a little cold now.
#Person2#: Shall we bring some umbrellas or raincoats for them?
#Person1#: How can you find them since we don't know where they are?
#Person2#: Well, we can only stay home and wait for them."
"#Person1#: Is there a lot of crime in your city?
#Person2#: There's some, but I don't think it's a big problem. A lot of it is petty crime, burglary and car theft. There's very little major crime.
#Person1#: It's the same in my city. We also have a lot of drug addicts. A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs.
#Person2#: That happens in many places. In my city, there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme. The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes, but I don't know if that's the reason for
#Person1#: Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.
#Person2#: I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly. If most people have similar amounts of money, they will not think of stealing from others.
#Person1#: That's possible, but I'm not sure it would really happen like that."
"#Person1#: What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me? 
#Person2#: Sure. Why don't you try it on? The fitting room is over there. 
#Person1#: It's just the right size-a perfect fit! Have you seen anything you like? 
#Person2#: I'm thinking about buying this sweater. I know it's june now, but it will be perfect for autumn and winter. 
#Person1#: It looks too big for you, but I like the color and the material is good quality. Is it on sale? 
#Person2#: Yes, it's half price. It's supposed to be too large-that's the fashion. 
#Person1#: I might get one too, but in a different colour. I prefer light blue to while. 
#Person2#: There. It looks great, don't you think? I'm going to get these jeans as well. I need a new pair. I need a new pair. I 'm also going to buy this scarf ready for winter.

#Person1#: Let me see. Yes, we have one room left. You're lucky. It's the last one.
#Person2#: Good. We're tired after driving all day, and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room.
#Person1#: This room has two double beds. It's number 56 at the rear of the motel. It's quite a comfortable room.

"#Person1#: Can you tell me about some good deals on produce?
#Person2#: The mangoes are on sale today.
#Person1#: What exactly are mangoes?
#Person2#: They have yellowish red skin. It's a fruit with one big seed.
#Person1#: Is the seed edible?
#Person2#: Maybe if you were a parrot. I wouldn't recommend it.
#Person1#: How much does a mango cost?
#Person2#: Normally, they're $ 2 each. Today, they're only $ 1 each.
#Person1#: Maybe I won't like the taste.
#Person2#: It's hard to describe. They're sweet, but also sort of acidity.
#Person1#: How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one?
#Person2#: They're similar to an avocado. When the outside feels soft, they're ripe.
#Person1#: Where do most of them come from?
#Person2#: These are from Mexico."
"#Person1#: May I help you?
#Person2#: Yes, please. Can I exchange money here?
#Person1#: Here we can exchange HAD, USD and Euros. Which do you require?
#Person2#: To be honest, I really wanted to exchange my GBP, but I suppose USD will be fine. I have some and I just need a little local currency for expenses. Could you tell me what the rate is like today?
#Person1#: At the moment it's 830. 43 RMB for 100 USD, which is a pretty good rate.
#Person2#: OK, that sounds fine. I think 200 USD worth of RMB should be plenty, thanks."
"#Person1#: May, could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today?
#Person2#: Sure, no problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester.
#Person1#: I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class.
#Person2#: I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class.
#Person1#: Yeah, my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.
#Person2#: Fortunately her class is just an elective course, not as important as compulsory courses.
#Person1#: Right, so we must spare some time to attend selective courses.
#Person2#: But isn't it too impolite to be absent?
#Person1#: What can I do? I have things to do in Students'Government.
#Person2#: Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note.
#Person1#: Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record.
#Person2#: Yeah, besides, your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious.
#Person1#: I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students'Government.
#Person2#: You can't write with one hand and draw with the other.
#Person1#: I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government. But before that, I must do my job. Bye. Don't forget about that note.
#Person2#: You can count on me."

#Person2#: You really want to babysit children all summer?
#Person1#: Oh, I love it here. The girls are fun, too.
#Person2#: Well, if you like it, I guess it'll be fun. My brother was a teacher at Camp Sequoia for many years. He enjoyed it a lot.
#Person1#: My camp is great, too. We go sailing and hiking in the woods, also I get to go horseback riding everyday.
#Person2#: How long will you be there?
#Person1#: Until the middle of August.

#Person2#: I like the colour very much. It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me. 
#Person1#: What about this one? It's a lovely dress. It's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it? 
#Person2#: All right. I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one. I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier. Co

#Person1#: do you know what camcorder options are available? 
#Person2#: not really. I thought I'd just have a look today. 
#Person1#: whould you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in? 
#Person2#: sure. I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first. 
#Person1#: ok. This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder. Why don't you see if you like the way it feel? 
#Person2#: it's very light. That would be good. How is the battery life? 
#Person1#: it's got an above-average battery life. It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes. 
#Person2#: can you also take still photos with this? 
#Person1#: yes, that is an option. 
#Person2#: how about night vision? Can you use it in the dark? 
#Person1#: yes. I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark. 
#Person2#: that's not bad at all. How's the microphone? Does it pick up much sound? 
#Person1#: It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera. 
#Person2#: how does that compare with other models? 
#Person1#: there are models that can pick up more sound than this one, but they're much bigger and heavier than this one. 
#Person2#: I guess you can't have everything, can you? "
"#Person1#: This place is different from the supermarket we're used to, isn't it? I don't come here very often because I think the prices are higher than those at supermarkets.
#Person2#: There isn't much of a selection. I mean, there are only 1 or 2 brands of each type of product, but that makes it easier to choose things.
#Person1#: When I'm not in a hurry, I usually enjoy comparing brands and prices. So I can get the most for my money.
#Person2#: At this time of night, this is probably the only place open.
#Person1#: I'm surprised at the milk prices. There are much lower than I expected. The prices are competitive with those of the large chains.
#Person2#: The prices are low on selected items, but the shop can't really compete with supermarkets when it comes to most things. At least there are no long lines here."
"#Person1#: Good morning, sir. Can I help you?
#Person2#: Good morning. I'm interested in antiques. Do you have any?
#Person1#: Yes, we have a great variety of Chinese antiques.
#Person2#: What do you have?
#Person1#: Well, we have some painting and some porcelain. Which do you like better?
#Person2#: I'd like porcelain.
#Person1#: Good. How about the table set?
#Person2#: Oh, it looks well. I like it very much.
#Person1#: It's made in Jingdezhen.
#Person2#: How much is it?
#Person1#: One thousand eight hundred yuan.
#Person2#: It's not expensive. I'll take it."
"#Person1#: What can I help you with?
#Person2#: I need to hire you.
#Person1#: What do you need me for?
#Person2#: I need you for my court date.
#Person1#: What kind of case do you have?
#Person2#: I'm being charged with a felony.
#Person1#: I can help you with that.
#Person2#: What is your price?
#Person1#: I charge $ 150 an hour.
#Person2#: I can't afford that.
#Person1#: That's my rate.
#Person2#: That's expensive, but I need you."
"#Person1#: Why do you have an umbrella with you? It's not supposed to rain today, is it?
#Person2#: No, but it's supposed to be very hot. I'll use this umbrella to protect myself from the sun as soon as these clouds go away.
#Person1#: I've never heard of using an umbrella for protection from the sun.
#Person2#: Did you know that the Chinese invented the umbrella, and that it's first use was for protection against the sun, not the rain?
#Person1#: I had no idea, you must get sunburned easily, huh?
#Person2#: Oh, absolutely. I always get super red if I haven't put on sun cream."
"#Person1#: can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen? I don't think I can finish everything in time.
#Person2#: ok, what do you want me to do?
#Person1#: first of all, I need you to do the drying up. I'm almost finished the washing up. I'm going to clean the cooker when I finish.
#Person2#: ok. I'll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them. Where is the tea towel? Oh, here it is.
#Person1#: we'll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it.
#Person2#: while you're cleaning the cooker, I'll wipe the worktop. That was a great meat, by the way.
#Person1#: actually, it was just some leftovers from yesterday. I made far too much food to eat alone. I am glad you could come over to help me finish it.
#Person2#: my pleasure! This tea towel's a little ragged. Do you have another one?
#Person1#: yes. Look in that drawer. I should throw the old one out.
#Person2#: keep it and use it as rag. You can clean your bicycle with it."
"#Person1#: Hello, Steven. Congratulations! 
#Person2#: Thank you. 
#Person1#: How's your married life? 
#Person2#: We're happy together now. We both think that we're a well-matched couple. 
#Person1#: That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right. 
#Person2#: The situation differs in person. "
"#Person1#: Hey, let me know how your summer's going! I'll miss you guys while I'm working here in the library.
#Person2#: I'll be working, too! But I'll send you an email or call you once in a while. When we all get back to school, we can have a party or something."
"#Person1#: My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray.
#Person2#: Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on, with the opening in the back.
#Person1#: What should I do after that?
#Person2#: You need to come over here and face this plate.
#Person1#: Am I standing the right way?
#Person2#: I will need your arms raised to shoulder height.
#Person1#: Am I doing this the right way?
#Person2#: Everything you are doing is perfect.
#Person1#: Are you going to leave?
#Person2#: I am just getting behind this screen. You need to take a deep breath, hold it, and then breathe normally.
#Person1#: Is that all there is to it?
#Person2#: You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed. We will be all done here."
"#Person1#: Hello, Yang Mei. I hear you're going to the United States.
#Person2#: Yes. I'm going with my grandma. We're going to see my parents in New Jersey.
#Person1#: When are you leaving, then?
#Person2#: This Friday evening. Our plane leaves at seven fifteen.
#Person1#: How long will you be there?
#Person2#: Six months.
#Person1#: Six months! Do you go and see my grandparents in New York?
#Person2#: Of course, I will. I want to see as many places as I can. How can I travel?
#Person1#: Most people travel by car. The roads are very good.
#Person2#: But I don't have a car and I can't drive. Is there any other way to travel?
#Person1#: You can travel by bus. It's very cheap.
#Person2#: Can't I travel by train?
#Person1#: Yes, you can. The train is expensive in the States, but it's fast.
#Person2#: Thank you very much. Well, must be off now. See you when I get back.
#Person1#: Good luck and have a good trip!"
"#Person1#: Hello, this is Li King. Can I talk to your manager?
#Person2#: Sorry, he has just gone out now. Can I take a message for you?
#Person1#: Yes. Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper?
#Person2#: OK, I got it."
"#Person1#: Alice, fancy that.
#Person2#: Yeah, Bruce. Fancy meeting you here.
#Person1#: I am here to refresh myself. I would like to feast my eyes on an excellent rugby game.
#Person2#: What is that?
#Person1#: It is the rugby game between at Yale and Harvard University a yearly event.It is also regarded as the glory fight for the 2 universities. It is the American version of the Oxford in Cambridge boat race.
#Person2#: That must be a big shot, I do not care about sports that much in the spare time. Can you tell me more?
#Person1#: You are finding the right person, my pleasure. This rugby game started in one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five and has been held 133 times. Usually taking place in November. The 2 universities take turns to be the host.
#Person2#: I know there are always cut throat competitions between the 2 universities, can it be seen as a kind of competition?
#Person1#: Yeah, exactly. Both universities counting much on it.
#Person2#: I bet the scene must be fantastic.
#Person1#: You set it. The stadium is full of audience. Whether it is in Yale or in Harvard, students have their own way of celebrating, such as waving flags, singing or showing logos. Both teams have their own colors and choirs.
#Person2#: I just couldn't help watching it."
"#Person1#: Hello everyone! I'm Rick Fields, and here with me is Bob Copeland.
#Person2#: Howdy folks, and welcome to today's game! You know, Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada. As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.
#Person1#: That's right, and it looks like we're just about ready to start the match. The ref is calling the players for the face-off. . . and here we go! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack! Federal gets checked hard into the boards!
#Person2#: Maurice Richard has the puck now, and passes it to the center. He shoots! Wow what a save by the goalie!

#Person2#: What an amazing goal!"
"#Person1#: Hi Bob. Did you talk to all of the witnesses to the car accident?
#Person2#: Yes, an old lady was standing on the street corner when the accident happened. She said that it was the red cars fault. It was driving very fast and then quickly stopped when the traffic light changed.
#Person1#: What did the kids say?
#Person2#: The kids were playing in their front yard and they said that they didn't see anything at all.
#Person1#: Did the neighbors see anything?
#Person2#: One of tje neighbors, Mr. Jones, said that he saw a dog run out into the street in front of the car.
#Person1#: No one else mentioned a dog. Did you talk to Mr. Bates? He is the man who was selling newspapers on the street corner.
#Person2#: Oh yeah, he said it was the blue car's fault.
#Person1#: Really?
#Person2#: Yeah, he said that the man in the blue car wasn't paying attention. When the red car stopped, he didn't notice until it was too late. Mr. Bates said he was the one who hit the red car.
#Person1#: Wow, did they all see the same accident? They all remember something different."
"#Person1#: what are you doing? 
#Person2#: I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle. Whenever I get the time, I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper. 
#Person1#: you really like brains that make you think, don't you? 
#Person2#: I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like? 
#Person1#: I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at! 
#Person2#: Doesn't everyone? Which games are those? 
#Person1#: Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours. 
#Person2#: Did you play a lot of games when you were little? 
#Person1#: My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend. 
#Person2#: Do you still like playing those games? 
#Person1#: Not at all. I never really did, to be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together? 
#Person2#: Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games. 
#Person1#: Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that? 
#Person2#: No, I prefer to play with people I know. 
#Person1#: How about mah-jong? 
#Person2#: It's a popular game with some people, but I've never played it. 
#Person1#: I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong! 
#Person2#: I hate to disappoint you, but unlike what most people think, we aren't all exactly the same! "
"#Person1#: You're a wonderful person, Kathleen. 
#Person2#: So you are. 
#Person1#: And I'm so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn't truly worthy. 
#Person2#: I feel exactly the same way with you. 
#Person1#: Don't, don't, don't, don't say that. That, that makes it worse. 
#Person2#: What? You don't love me? Me, either. 
#Person1#: You don't love me? 
#Person2#: No.

#Person1#: Well, how about going skating?
#Person2#: I'd like to, but my knee hurts, too.
#Person1#: Harry, stop making excuses. You're just lazy.
#Person2#: No, I'm not. You know there's a basketball match on TV today. Let's just stay at home and watch it.

#Person2#: Yes, I think I will do something new. I've always wanted to be a teacher. 
#Person1#: I admire your energy, Ruth. You are young at heart. "
"#Person1#: Oh, the clothes here are so expensive! No wonder there are few people.
#Person2#: Beauty costs, dear! What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me?
#Person1#: Yeah, it's lovely, but to be frank, it's not the most practical. You don't have many formal events in your calendar, do you?
#Person2#: Come on, you sound like my Mom. Look at it, it's beautiful!
#Person1#: When you buy clothes, you must think about the material, quality and price.
#Person2#: Maybe you have a point.
#Person1#: Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions.
#Person2#: All right. How about this black skirt? It can be worn for anything---a party, a job interview and even a funeral!
#Person1#: That's true, but you already have two back coats and one black sweater.
#Person2#: Oh! Hey, look, that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert.
#Person1#: Exactly! Oh, my god! I love Britney! I'm going to get it.
#Person2#: Why not try it on?
#Person1#: It's just the right size--a perfect fit! I'll take it. Oh, no, I'm a little short. Did you bring your credit card?

#Person1#: I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home."
"#Person1#: Can you read what this says? 
#Person2#: Yes, and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face. 
#Person1#: Don't dis my hair! I like it like this. 
#Person2#: You like it, but it's getting to be a handicap for you. 
#Person1#: Hey, that's enough about my hair. 
#Person2#: I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too. 
#Person1#: I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute. 
#Person2#: Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too? "
"#Person1#: I'm going over to the gym. I want to do some running.
#Person2#: Why don't you run outside?
#Person1#: Are you kidding? Do you know how cold it is today?
#Person2#: Yeah, I suppose. I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather.
#Person1#: No, it's not. Not at all. I'd probably freeze my lungs.
#Person2#: Wait for me a minute. I'll go over to the gym too.
#Person1#: You?
#Person2#: Yes, why not? Just let me get my gym clothes together.
#Person1#: I didn't know you could exercise.
#Person2#: What do you mean by that? Everyone can exercise!
#Person1#: Yeah, I know. But you? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth.
#Person2#: No, not at all. I was on the swimming team in high school. And I'd like to do some weight training. They have decent equipment at that gym.
#Person1#: You're going to lift weights? Hah!
#Person2#: Are you laughing at me?
#Person1#: I'm sorry. I just can't imagine you lifting weights.
#Person2#: Maybe not. But I want to start. I need to get in shape. I feel these past couple months that my energy is low.
#Person1#: It's true. If a person doesn't exercise, they get sluggish. That's why I keep running. Even in the winter.
#Person2#: So I need to do something too.
#Person1#: But lifting weights isn't the best thing. You should do some kind of aerobic exercise.
#Person2#: I know. But I want to start today with a little weight lifting. Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles, and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool. How does that sound?
#Person1#: It sounds like a good plan to me. I'm still. . . I mean. . .
#Person2#: What?
#Person1#: I'm still just surprised you really want to do it. It doesn't seem to go with your character."

"#Person1#: This apartment is wonderful.
#Person2#: I'm glad you like it.

#Person1#: That's way too much money.
#Person2#: It isn't too much.
#Person1#: How about if I pay $ 850?
#Person2#: I can't take that.
#Person1#: I can't go any higher than $ 850.
#Person2#: I honestly don't know what else to tell you.
#Person1#: You can't go any lower than that?
#Person2#: If you can't afford $ 1050, then we have no deal."
"#Person1#: So, do you have any special plans for this year?
#Person2#: Yes, I'm going to join the Drama Club.

#Person1#: And I'm going to study a lot this year. I have to get good grades.
#Person2#: So do I!"
"#Person1#: We are looking for a bilingual secretary. Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English?
#Person2#: I think my English is fairly good. As you can see from my CV, I graduated from university with a B. A. degree in English. I studied the English language and English literature systematically.
#Person1#: How are your typing and shorthand skills?
#Person2#: I can type 80 words a minute, basically no mistake, and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute."
"#Person1#: Hello, Karl. I haven't seen you since we both went to university.
#Person2#: Good to see you, Laura. I'm just back home for a few days.
#Person1#: Me too. How are you finding it studying in a foreign country?
#Person2#: I had to find my own accommodation, although the university was very helpful and gave me a list of apartments so it wasn't that hard. The language isn't a problem because my course is taught in English. But understanding the other students' jokes isn't easy.
#Person1#: Sounds like fun, though. Well, I've been in City University London for 2 years. I'm really concentrating on my studies at the moment because I've got an important essay to write. Have you thought about what you'll do after your University course finishes?
#Person2#: I haven't made up my mind actually.
#Person1#: You must feel lonely sometimes abroad. I thought I'd love the freedom of being away from home, but it can be hard.
#Person2#: Well, it's normal to feel like that. Why don't you come and visit me when you can afford it?
#Person1#: I'm really curious to see what it's like at your university. I've got more than enough studying to do at the moment, though, I'm afraid"

#Person2#: Basically I'm just here to help people with any problems so I meet customers when they come into the store and talk to them. I advise them about the best things to buy. I don't actually take the money. I just help people decide what to buy.
#Person1#: What's the most difficult thing about your job?
#Person2#: Em, well, we sell more than 2000 different products in the store. So it's very difficult to have all the information to know everything about all the products.
#Person1#: What do you like about your job?
#Person2#: Well, I'm very interested in technology, computers and everything and working in the shop. I get the chance to find out about all the latest things."

#Person1#: And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it? 
#Person2#: Montreal is more exciting. It has better shopping. The stores are cheaper and more interesting. 
#Person1#: Which one has better nightlife?

#Person2#: Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens. It's a very historic city.
#Person1#: How was the weather?
#Person2#: I was in Tokyo in August, and it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October. It was hot and sunny, but there was no humidity.
#Person1#: Sounds perfect. I can't wait!"
"#Person1#: Are you ready to go shopping? 
#Person2#: Not yet. I'm not finished with my research yet. 
#Person1#: What research? 
#Person2#: Reading my fashion magazines! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends? 
#Person1#: But they're just ads. . . 
#Person2#: Duh. . . That's the point. The people in the ads are wearing what's in. Plus, there are articles on new trends. . . "
"#Person1#: Sorry to bother you sir, but I have some bad news.
#Person2#: What is it?
#Person1#: Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we'Ve lost a lot of money!
#Person2#: What do you mean? What happened?
#Person1#: There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW JONES indicator also suffered! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago.
#Person2#: How is this possible? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return!
#Person1#: I know sir! We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden. On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets. We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.
#Person2#: Do what you have to do! One other thing, don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this. If they find out, it's the end of this company!"
"#Person1#: Hello, Parker. How's everything?
#Person2#: Can't complain. And you?
#Person1#: Business is booming. I understand you want to meet up with me next week. How's your schedule look?
#Person2#: Let me see. I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday.
#Person1#: Great."
"#Person1#: Have you settled in?
#Person2#: Yes, I feel quite at home now. I haven't got used to the food yet, but I'm enjoying the life on campus.
#Person1#: Good. Now we'd better make sure you enjoy your studies. We offer a very wide range of options on the foundation course, as you know; but you can only take six modules -do you know what you want to do yet?
#Person2#: Yes, more or less, but I'm not sure whether to do biological sciences or German.
#Person1#: Well, that's quite a difference. You want to do computer studies, don't you?
#Person2#: Mmmmm, yeh.
#Person1#: Well, let's see-you elected to do physical sciences, basic electronics, art and design CAD-that computers and design-isn't it?
#Person2#: Computer-aided design actually, 'CAD', but...
#Person1#: Oh, right-anyway, CAD and..., and English. That's quite a range. Don't you want to do maths-or computer programming, for example? Why don't you choose to do art and design?
#Person2#: Well, I'm interested in electronics-in computer-especially in writing computer games. I'd like to produce educational software, educational games, eventually. I've taught myself a lot of programming- I... I don't think I'd benefit much from a foundation level course.
#Person1#: No... no, I see that-go on.
#Person2#: So, er, I want the basics-the physical science and electronics I was hopeless at physics in school and we didn't have electronics-but I was good at maths-I don't think I need that.
#Person1#: And the art and design?
#Person2#: That will be good for my graphics-I need that to produce games-CAD too-I've never done CAD before.
#Person1#: No-right-they've got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices-you'll enjoy that. So... that leaves English. It's mostly English lit. I know your English is very good, but did you know you can take English as a foreign language as one of the modules in the foundation year?
#Person2#: No... no, I didn't. That's great - if they've got classes at my level. I don't have any problem speaking-but my writing is terrible.
#Person1#: Oh, I'm sure they have-go and talk to them in the EAP department-oh, and I suggest you join the study-skill classes, too. They will have sessions on report and so on.
#Person2#: Great-I really need some help with my writing, especially spelling.
#Person1#: Well, that would be in the EFL classes-study-skills would help more with how to structure your essays and so on... now, your last module...
#Person2#: Yeh... well... I gave up biology at school to do physical-but I much prefer biology -I'd like to study some more While I can but German is very important in technical subjects, so I want to do that too.
#Person1#: Well, you could do it as an option next year-you do know that?
#Person2#: No, I don't-I mean, I didn't cheek.
#Person1#: Yes... yes, I think that's the thing to do-concentrate on your English this year you could take Cambridge proficiency-and you'll need LELTS for the first year of the degree -start the German next year.
#Person2#: Right-that sounds good.
#Person1#: Good. Well, if you have any problems academic or otherwise, just come and see me.
#Person2#: OK, thanks.
#Person1#: I am on extension 7549.
#Person2#: 7549.
#Person1#: That's it-just leave a message if I'm not in the office-OK, if there is nothing else...
#Person2#: No... no, that's fine, thanks.
#Person1#: Good-bye for now, then.
#Person2#: Bye."
"#Person1#: pompous. How may I help you?
#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to reserve a table for dinner.
#Person1#: How large a group are you expecting?
#Person2#: Six couples.
#Person1#: Would you like to reserve a private dining room?
#Person2#: That sounds like a good idea.
#Person1#: All right. May I have your name, Sir?
#Person2#: My name is Ron Kollwitz."
"#Person1#: Whoa. Now I'm awake! Zina has a secret admirer.
#Person2#: I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek.
#Person1#: I know what you mean. I can't stand computer geeks.
#Person2#: Sorry, Dave, I didn't mean you. I am just not in the mood for this. I have work to do.
#Person1#: Who do you think it is?"
"#Person1#: What is this eviction notice for?
#Person2#: The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate.
#Person1#: Are you kidding me?
#Person2#: I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent. This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business.
#Person1#: You can't just throw me out on the street!
#Person2#: You have 30 days to catch up on your rent, or a sheriff will evict you.
#Person1#: Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment?
#Person2#: You can stay, but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments.
#Person1#: I am going to take care of the rent payment right now.
#Person2#: Thank you. The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier's check."
"#Person1#: Hi, Kate.
#Person2#: Hi, Don. What a surprise!
#Person1#: Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn't sure. We haven't seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now.
#Person2#: Have you noticed what has changed?
#Person1#: Oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?
#Person2#: Yes. I'm on a diet, but I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds.
#Person1#: Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break.
#Person2#: What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I'm taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday.
#Person1#: Dance? You only go dancing? That's not hard. I can do that.
#Person2#: Sure. Join my class next week."
"#Person1#: Can you show me how to use this phone?
#Person2#: Yes, I can help you with that. Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons. Do you hear a tone?
#Person1#: No, I don't hear anything.
#Person2#: Next you dial 9 on the keypad. You should hear the tone change. Did you hear it change?
#Person1#: I'm not sure.
#Person2#: OK. Well, after you get the line to change you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call?
#Person1#: I am trying to call a client.
#Person2#: To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number. For inside calls, punch in the extension number. Has someone given you an extension list?
#Person1#: No, I don't know anyone's extension.
#Person2#: All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help."
"#Person1#: Excuse me, sir, the toilet in my room doesn't flush.
#Person2#: I am sorry, sir. Can you tell me your room number?
#Person1#: 812.
#Person2#: Is there anything else I can do for you?
#Person1#: The tap is always driving. I can't sleep well.
#Person2#: OK, we will send a repairman to your room right now."
"#Person1#: How good are you at sports, Bill?
#Person2#: Are you kidding? I'm terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week.
#Person1#: Wow!
#Person2#: Do you like sports, Janice?
#Person1#: Oh, yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.
#Person2#: Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?
#Person1#: Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward.
#Person2#: That's great! I'Ve heard people say that before.
#Person1#: Well, why don't you try to get some exercise? It's difficult, but very rewarding.
#Person2#: Oh, I'm too lazy to play sports, and I'm not good at anything either. It hardly excites me."
"#Person1#: Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China. It seems to me in every school, factory, army unit, or residential area, men and women, young and old, are swinging paddles.
#Person2#: You got it! In a sense, it has become a byword for Chinese sport.
#Person1#: What do you think might be the source of its popularity?
#Person2#: I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost. All you need is a racket, a table and a light celluloid ball. Tables are usually available in public recreation areas, like finest rooms, and outdoor playgrounds. . .
#Person1#: And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks.
#Person2#: Put it there! In senior high schools, we used to play on desks in the classroom, when no vacant tables were available. Likewise, the racket may take a variety of forms, too. Anything that resembles a racket, from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book, may be used as a racket.
#Person1#: Haha, these are very good inventions. All these speak the public's fondness for the sport
#Person2#: Yeah, the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom, Dick and Jane in this developing country. No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it.
#Person1#: I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong.
#Person2#: Actually, he excels in it. Chairman Mao, too, encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign.
#Person1#: I see. There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy, wasn't there?"
"#Person1#: Thanks. Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something. Do you mind if I vent a little bit?
#Person2#: Of course not. If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out, you can just say whatever you want to me.
#Person1#: Great, because I am really mad at William. I mean, what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart, beautiful woman like me? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb.
#Person2#: Uh, A. . . you know I'm friends with William.
#Person1#: Oh right. . . present company excluded, of course!"
"#Person1#: What are the most popular sports in your country?
#Person2#: Swimming in summer and skating in winter. What ' s your favorite sport?
#Person1#: Jogging and bowling. Do you know how to practise Bungfu?
#Person2#: No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing. People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning. It can help people keep fit. It has a history of over three hundred years.
#Person1#: Is it easy to learn?
#Person2#: Yes. it is I can teach you if you like.
#Person1#: Thank you. I can teach you how to bowl.
#Person2#: Right. Let's help each other."
"#Person1#: Can I help you? 
#Person2#: I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit. 
#Person1#: We have various colors. How about this one? 
#Person2#: Well, the color is all right. But it looks outdated. Can you show me that one? 
#Person1#: You have a very good taste. It's our best seller. 
#Person2#: Really? 
#Person1#: Sure! Look, it suits you well. "
"#Person1#: I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both. I've thought through a lot of these details, and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon.
#Person2#: Let's get start. What kinds of things do you have in mind? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning, we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement.
#Person1#: Firstly, we'd like to discuss a discounted price. If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders, we can pay in 60 days.
#Person2#: Huh. . . I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do. How about this? We'll give you a discount of 4 %, but you can have 90 days credits.
#Person1#: Well, that might be acceptable, if you handle the insurance fees.
#Person2#: No, you have to take care of the insurance. But we are willing to pay the half transport. Can you accept that?
#Person1#: We cover the insurance and half the transport fee, and only have a discount of 4 %.
#Person2#: But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what. . . I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit.
#Person1#: Done. . ."
"#Person1#: The plants next to the window always look brown. You wouldn't know by looking at them that I water them every week.
#Person2#: Maybe they don't like direct sunlight. I had the same problem with some of my plants. And a little shade helps them immensely."
"#Person1#: I hear you're going home, aren't you?
#Person2#: I wanted to go on Monday, but I couldn't get a ticket for Monday, I bought a ticket for Tuesday.
#Person1#: Why are you in such a hurry?
#Person2#: My mother is ill. She has been sent to the hospital.
#Person1#: How did you get the news? Did your mother send you a letter?
#Person2#: My sister telephoned me this morning. She asked my father and me to go back.
#Person1#: Then how long are you going to stay at home, two or three days?
#Person2#: At most four days. I'll be back for the meeting."
"#Person1#: On today's show we have Dennis Dean, owner of Double the Fun bus parties. Hi, Dennis. Can you tell us what you do?
#Person2#: Well, Double the Fun is a party bus where you and up to 50 friends can hold celebrations. All buses have fridges for cold drinks, disco-quality sound, an amazing light show and comfortable leather seats. What we don't have is cooking equipment. All buses also have a bus host, whose job is to make sure all the guests get back on the bus after each stop.
#Person1#: After each stop? So guests don't spend the whole evening driving around on the bus?
#Person2#: No! In fact, we take them to 4 different clubs during the evening. At each club, we've booked special VIP entrance, which means no waiting to get in, and everyone gets a free drink.
#Person1#: Anything else our listeners should know about the parties?
#Person2#: Yes, all guests must be smartly dressed. No jeans or sports shoes. The only exception would be if they want to have a fancy-dress party. And we need to know the time you book if you are planning a fancy-dress party. Clubs like to know in advance when parties will be arriving.
#Person1#: Thanks, Dennis."
"#Person1#: Honey, would you marry me?
#Person2#: I want to think about it for some time.
#Person1#: Please, honey, I have made proposals to you fifteen times.
#Person2#: I know. But your way doesn't touch my heart.
#Person1#: Oh, god, please tell me how.
#Person2#: I can't tell you.
#Person1#: OK, I want you to be happy when we are together, and when you are sad, I would always stay with you.
#Person2#: When I am angry and want to beat someone, you stand there and let me do what I want. Would you?
#Person1#: Yes, I would. Thanks for being in my life.
#Person2#: Don't be so happy, it is just one of my tests!"
"#Person1#: I am very interested in a new apartment near the Tianxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it. 
#Person2#: How much is it for each square meter? How large is the apartment? 
#Person1#: It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters. 
#Person2#: That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment? 
#Person1#: Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25% down payment, I can move in at once. 
#Person2#: If sounds so tempting. Why not go applying for a loan from the bank? They charge very low interest, so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years. "
"#Person1#: Your goofy personality, your fatal curiosity. . . you've always reminded me of Curious George. 
#Person2#: Well, thanks a lot! I bet I can guess your zodiac sign, too! 
#Person1#: Go ahead! ! 
#Person2#: I bet you're a snake! 
#Person1#: How'd you guess? 
#Person2#: Well, you're sneaky, conniving, cold blooded. . . "
"#Person1#: Do you think you can take me to the Grand Hotel in 30 minutes?
#Person2#: It depends. If the traffic isn't too heavy... Anyhow, I'll try my best. You've got enough time.
#Person1#: How much should I pay?
#Person2#: $12.75, please.
#Person1#: Thanks a lot. Here's $15. Give me $1.00 back, please."
"#Person1#: Hi Judy. Did you see this notice in the dining hall?
#Person2#: Yeah, Sam. I don't like it. I usually sit here and talk with my friends after lunch until my first class at 2:00 in the afternoon. Now we have to find someplace else to go.
#Person1#: But we have lots of other places to go. We can go to the school park.
#Person2#: That means carrying all my books.
#Person1#: But they explain this will help keep the cost of food down and we can save some extra money."
"#Person1#: I want to take the children out next Saturday.
#Person2#: That's eleventh, isn't it?
#Person1#: NO, it's twelfth.
#Person2#: Where do you want to take them?
#Person1#: To the zoo.
#Person2#: I remember you took them there last month. They don't like it.
#Person1#: Really? But that'S not what they told me.
#Person2#: I think the beach is a better place to go.
#Person1#: Okay, then, we can go to the beach.
#Person2#: I'll get them ready for you in the morning."
"#Person1#: We'd like to rent a flat near the university.
#Person2#: Are you looking for somewhere for two people?
#Person1#: Yes, we are. Obviously, we'd like something as cheap as possible. We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month.
#Person2#: Yes, there are several place available in that price range near the university. Do you have any other requirements?
#Person1#: Not really, no. We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street.
#Person2#: How many rooms do you need in the flat?
#Person1#: We'll need two bedrooms. The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined.
#Person2#: Ok. I've got a list of place that fit your requirements. Let's just go through them. The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university.
#Person1#: How far away is it from the campus?
#Person2#: It's about two miles away. that might be a little far to walk. Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, just off a main street.
#Person1#: That sounds ideal. Can we go to have a look at it? we'd like to see it before making a final decision.
#Person2#: Of course. I'm not very busy at the moment. If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes. I can take you there.
#Person1#: Thank you. That would be great."
"#Person1#: Hi, Hilly here! You are 15 minutes late. The game has started.
#Person2#: I'm terribly sorry. I have classes the whole day so I forgot all about it. I came to tell you I can't go with you today.
#Person1#: Good heavens! What's the matter with you? You seem so busy.
#Person2#: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have got a difficult project to deal with. I've been trying to do it for the last 3 days and I still haven't finished it. I will have a meeting with my tutor tomorrow morning and he wants to see my report. I'm awfully sorry."
"#Person1#: Hello, Dan. I was sorry to hear that you had an accident last week. How did it happen and how are you feeling now?
#Person2#: Well, I was riding on my bicycle along the street, when a taxi driver suddenly made a sharp turn in front of me. I could not stop my bicycle in time and I was knocked down. Fortunately, I only got a broken arm and a broken leg. The doctor said that I would have to stay in hospital for at least a week.
#Person1#: Do your arm and leg hurt now?
#Person2#: Yes, my leg hurts badly, but I can bear the pain. The only thing that I'm worried about is my classes, you know? Our teacher said next week, we would have our midterm exams.
#Person1#: Well, don't worry about the exams. I can help you.
#Person2#: Thank you. But I don't really want to stay here that long. Anyway, thank you for coming to see me."
"#Person1#: Mrs. Daniels, I'm confused about this essay. I thought I was supposed to write about my own life.
#Person2#: You're supposed to write about the book. But if you'd like to relate it to your own life, you can. The main part of your essay should be about the book.
#Person1#: I see. I think I will have to rewrite what I've already written, since most of my essay doesn't have anything to do with the book.
#Person2#: That's probably a good idea."
"#Person1#: Good afternoon, San Felice Hotel. May I help you?

#Person2#: Goodbye."
"#Person1#: The NASDAQ gained a few points today.
#Person2#: Does it mean anything?
#Person1#: It's hard to say. The stock market is weird. You never know what will happen tomorrow.
#Person2#: Why do you buy stocks, then?
#Person1#: It's a kind of investment. If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough, I can get good returns."
"#Person1#: I just received an Email from one of my former classmates. I was surprised. I hadn't heard from him for ages.
#Person2#: Well, I've been out of touch with most of my old friends. Only one or two still drop me a line occasionally."
"#Person1#: Hello Mr.Johnson, you wanted to talk to me?
#Person2#: Uh, yeah, come on in! I'm glad you were able to make it in such a short time. I was worried I wouldn't get a chance to talk with you before the weekend.
#Person1#: Luckily, I checked my email and got your message before leaving campus for the evening. I thought it would be good to drop by and I'm surprised you're here at such a late hour.
#Person2#: Oh, I usually am on Fridays. I like to review the weekly writings. My students turn in before I leave for the seaside on weekends.
#Person1#: To be frank, I'm a little bit nervous.
#Person2#: Don't be nervous. Actually, it's very good news.
#Person1#: Oh, what is it?
#Person2#: I received a letter from the National Youth Fund. It says you have won a scholarship for your further studies."
"#Person1#: You would be using mainly English in this job. Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease?
#Person2#: Yes, I think I speak English quite fluently. I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English. They say my English is quite good.
#Person1#: How many years have you been learning English?
#Person2#: Oh, more than ten years. I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher.
#Person1#: Well, perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it.
#Person2#: Certainly."
"#Person1#: Can I order something from the kitchen?
#Person2#: Just tell me what you'd like, please.
#Person1#: A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit the spot.
#Person2#: I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
#Person1#: Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!
#Person2#: Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne?
#Person1#: Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries.
#Person2#: That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all charged to your amenities account.
#Person1#: Not a problem.
#Person2#: Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered promptly."
"#Person1#: I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it means.
#Person2#: Well, you are behind in your rent ; it's a 30 - day notice to vacate.
#Person1#: You can't make me move just for being late with my rent.
#Person2#: You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself.
#Person1#: Are you throwing me out?
#Person2#: This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don't make good on your rent.
#Person1#: If I catch up on my rent, can I stay?
#Person2#: You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find another renter.
#Person1#: I will go get the money right now.
#Person2#: Thank you. Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier's check."
"#Person1#: Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?
#Person2#: Good afternoon, I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired.
#Person1#: Which brand are you interested in?
#Person2#: I'm still not sure. The type with top quality, I guess. Well, which one do you recommend?
#Person1#: Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones?
#Person2#: It doesn't matter much. If it has high quality and reasonable price, it will be OK.
#Person1#: How about Flymo? It's selling well.
#Person2#: Do you have a warranty on it?
#Person1#: Of course. The warranty period is one year.
#Person2#: If there's something wrong with it in a week, can I come back to change it?
#Person1#: Sure. But you must show us the receipt. If something comes up, we'll change it for you.
#Person2#: OK. I'll take one."
"#Person1#: Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue.
#Person2#: It is true. I think we should change some policies.
#Person1#: Right. Like our LPF program. The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts.
#Person2#: Indeed, it's unfair. Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans. Lower-income households, on the other hand, can only get smaller loans, or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing.
#Person1#: Like you and me!"
"#Person1#: I would like to ask for one day off next week. Do you think the manager will agree? I know it is the busy time for our company, but I do have some important things to handle.
#Person2#: Well, it is hard to say. At least you need to come up with a good reason.
#Person1#: Actually, it is my mother's wedding. My parents divorced many years ago. Now she is ready to establish a new family. It is a special occasion. I'Ve got to be there, right?
#Person2#: Yes, you should be there. Go find the manager and ask. I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off. Don't forget to fill in the leave application form. It will be signed by the manager for approval.
#Person1#: Thank you so much."
"#Person1#: Oh dear, I gained these 10 pounds in the last 3 months, none of my clothes fit any more.

#Person1#: Do you have an appointment?
#Person2#: Yes, he knows I'm coming. Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock.
#Person1#: I wonder if Mr. Smith forgot your meeting. I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p. m. Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place. Will you please have a seat?
#Person2#: Sure.
#Person1#: Yes, Mr. Mason. I just checked with our office manager, Ms. Terry. She said Mr. Smith briefed her on your project. She is just finishing up a meeting now. She should be with you shortly. Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting?

#Person2#: I found the ideal position. I'm working for a plumbing company.
#Person1#: Are you serious? You studied mathematics at college for four years, and now you have a job working with your hands!
#Person2#: Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge, and creativity. I love this job.
#Person1#: I can see that. But I didn't know you had experience in that line of work.
#Person2#: I didn't, but I applied for an apprenticeship, and since I studied math, AND I have a good attitude, my application was accepted.
#Person1#: Congratulations! You do have the right attitude."

#Person1#: I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical. 
#Person2#: Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems. 
#Person1#: We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should. 
#Person2#: I've been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that? 
#Person1#: I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion. 
#Person2#: That would be great. What is the blood test for? 
#Person1#: The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar. 
#Person2#: I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly. "

#Person2#: Blanca, I'll see you tomorrow."
"#Person1#: I haven't met you at the gym for a long time.
#Person2#: yeah, I quit my job, and started working from home. Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out.
#Person1#: why? You have a decent salary, lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o'clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening.
#Person2#: it's not about pay raise or promotion. You know, I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night.
#Person1#: then SOHO is your ideal work style.
#Person2#: yeah, as long as I have a computer and internet access, I can start working. I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace.
#Person1#: and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control.
#Person2#: absolutely. I can decide when and what to do all by myself.
#Person1#: sounds great. Are there many business opportunity?
#Person2#: yeah, I can find enough online.
#Person1#: it's good to have business around. But you should also do some exercise to keep fit.
#Person2#: thank you for reminding me. I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project."
"#Person1#: I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers. 
#Person2#: Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsberg is less than $1. 
#Person1#: Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you? 
#Person2#: It's fashionable. 
#Person1#: Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity. 
#Person2#: Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun. 
#Person1#: How? By drinking? 
#Person2#: Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed. 
#Person1#: When did you begin to drink? 
#Person2#: It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said' can I buy you a drink? ' 
#Person1#: And then? 
#Person2#: Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink. 
#Person1#: So you get drunk every day? "
"#Person1#: Ted, it's really you? I just cannot believe it! You've really put on some weight.
#Person2#: Yeah, that's true. Actually, I'm losing weight now. Now I go to the gym at least 3 times a week. So how have you been?
#Person1#: Not bad. I've changed my job. You know, now I'm not as busy as before, and I spend more time hanging out with friends and sleeping.
#Person2#: Do you also exercise?
#Person1#: Not really. But I'm on a diet, I don't want to put on any weight.
#Person2#: Well, I think working out works better. I've really fallen in love with exercising. You can give it a shot, too.
#Person1#: I'll consider that."
"#Person1#: Have you got anything for diarrhea?
#Person2#: Yes, here you are. These tablets are very effective.
#Person1#: How should I take this medicine?
#Person2#: Take two tablets every six hours.
#Person1#: I see. I'll follow your instructions.
#Person2#: And take a good rest for a few days.
#Person1#: Thank you."
"#Person1#: Andrew, you're quite a hero, aren't you?
#Person2#: Am I? I didn't know.
#Person1#: Have you ever been on the radio before?
#Person2#: No, not really. I mean I've never found so much money before.
#Person1#: Tell me what happened that morning.
#Person2#: Well, I collected my newspapers at about 8 o'clock and started my pa- per around. I went past the phone box and I saw this black bag in one comer. I got off my bike to have a better look. It was just an ordinary case. So I decided to find out who it belonged to.
#Person1#: When did you realize it was money?
#Person2#: As soon as I opened it.
#Person1#: What did you do next?
#Person2#: I rushed out of the box, went to the nearest house, and phoned the police.
#Person1#: what did the police do with the bag?
#Person2#: I didn't stay to find out. I had to go and continue the delivery of my newspapers.
#Person1#: Were you late for school?
#Person2#: Only about five minutes. Nobody seemed to mind."
"#Person1#: I heard you were teaching English over there. Tell me about it. Did you like it?
#Person2#: Oh, yes, it was very interesting.
#Person1#: What were the schools like?
#Person2#: Oh, I didn't actually teach in the schools. I taught after school. I taught in English institutes.
#Person1#: But you taught children, yes?
#Person2#: Yes. That's right. But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America. At least as far as studying is concerned. Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school.
#Person1#: They actually study after school?
#Person2#: That's right. After their school day is over, they go to a special institute to study math or English. They are very serious about learning over there.
#Person1#: Hmm. That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids. Don't they ever relax?
#Person2#: Of course they do. You know, Eliza, before I went over there I thought the same thing. I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much. But now that I've worked there, and taught them, I feel it is a good thing. Their parents are very concerned about their education. More than American parents are. And that is good. American kids don't study enough.
#Person1#: Asian cultures value learning very much. I know that.
#Person2#: So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education. They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing. In America, too many parents don't pay attention.
#Person1#: But aren't the kids tired out? I mean, they go to school all day, and then they go to school in the evening too.
#Person2#: As an English teacher, I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible. I tried to have a good time with my classes. The students often enjoyed it. And if the students enjoyed it, they learned more. So it was a good experience.
#Person1#: Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient?
#Person2#: That's a stereotype we Americans have. We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet. But it's not true. There are plenty of naughty kids too.
#Person1#: Hmm. I know you taught in Costa Rica also. Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan?
#Person2#: I don't know. In Costa Rica, I taught adults. So it was a very different thing. So I really can't compare."
"#Person1#: Oh, what a pretty dress! My daughter would love it. But it seems a bit too large. Do you have a smaller size?
#Person2#: Sorry, this is the only one left. But don't worry. Children grow fast.
#Person1#: Yes, that's true. I'll take it."
"#Person1#: Good afternoon. I've brought the extra blanket you asked for.
#Person2#: Oh, thank you.
#Person1#: Is there anything I can do for you now?
#Person2#: Yes. I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early. Please make the bed.
#Person1#: Certainly, sir."
"#Person1#: Oh, it's you, Mrs. Bramley. Come in and sit down. Now, what was it? Oh, yes, your ankle. Has there been any improvement since last week?
#Person2#: Well, no, I'm afraid not, doctor. The leg's still the same.
#Person1#: I'd better have another look at it. HM! It's still very swollen. Have you been resting it, as! told you to?
#Person2#: It's so difficult to rest it, doctor, you know, with a house to run, and six children to look after.
#Person1#: Well, I've given you my advise. I'm sorry, but rest is necessary, otherwise I wouldn't have insisted on it. You must sit for at least four hours a day with the leg raised. Otherwise the ankle isn't going to improve. You understand that?
#Person2#: Yes, I understand, and I'll try to do as you say.
#Person1#: Very well then. I'll repeat that prescription for tablets, but the only effective treatment is rest. Ask the next patient to come in please."
"#Person1#: Have you a bus tour round the city?
#Person2#: Yes, of course. Do you want to join the day tour or the night tour?
#Person1#: Day tour. How much does that cost?
#Person2#: $ 20.
#Person1#: Is lunch included?
#Person2#: Of course. You will have the local specialties."
"#Person1#: Excuse me. We're leaving today. I'd like to pay our bills now.
#Person2#: OK. By the way, I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
#Person1#: I see.
#Person2#: Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room, Mr. Green?
#Person1#: Yes, my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room, but we didn't use any services.
#Person2#: How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend?
#Person1#: Please add to my account.
#Person2#: The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan.
#Person1#: OK. Here you are."
"#Person1#: Hi, what're you reading? 
#Person2#: An old book Death on the Nile. Have you read it? 
#Person1#: Not yet, but I saw the movie. Could I borrow it when you finish reading? 
#Person2#: Sure. But you need to be patient. "
"#Person1#: Matt, do you have a pet?
#Person2#: Yes. In fact in my mom's house, we have 3 pets, 2 dogs and a cat. My family actually raises dogs for helping blind People.
#Person1#: Oh, wow. That's cool! Um, Why do people keep pets?
#Person2#: I guess the most important thing is companionship, right? So there is always somebody there for you that will like you.
#Person1#: Yeah, that's true. Ok, besides cats, dogs and fish. What are some other pets people keep?
#Person2#: Well, I guess all types of things. My friend has a snake. I don't know if you mentioned that, snake and insects, spiders."
"#Person1#: I have with me this evening, Louise Graham, a group leader at Ravens Field Outdoor Adventure Center for children. Louise, how long have you been there?
#Person2#: Well, before I first went there 2 years ago, I thought I'd probably only stay for a year. But after 6 months or so. I really started to enjoy the job, so I'd been there ever since. To be honest, I was lacking in self confidence and when I first arrived I was a bit worried about making mistakes. I was frightened I might put the children in danger because of my inexperience.
#Person1#: What's the best thing about your work?
#Person2#: One thing I like is seeing them have so much fun. Even if sometimes their behavior isn't perfect, and I can suggest activities that haven't been tried before, but there are always some children who haven't quite got as much ability as others, and for me, the most rewarding part of the job is getting them to succeed and things they haven't managed to do before. It's hard work though, sometimes you're on duty at night.
#Person1#: Um, what do you think about that?
#Person2#: Well, I can't say I look forward to starting work at 10:00 PM. But the kids have to be looked after 24 hours, so someone has to do it, and all the staff take turns."
"#Person1#: How long have you played the piano? You're great.
#Person2#: Thanks, I've been playing since I was 9 and now I'm 17. I have to practice for 2 hours every day, but I love it.
#Person1#: That's good. Since you do it so much, I wouldn't be able to sit still that long. Why do you like it?
#Person2#: Well, now that I have more experience I write my own music. I feel creative and I enjoy making people happy as they listen to me.
#Person1#: That's cool. I feel that way when I play soccer. When I play I feel good about using my skills and people like to watch me, you know what I mean?
#Person2#: Exactly."
"#Person1#: Hey, where is everybody?
#Person2#: They took Ben to the park. Where have you been?
#Person1#: Sorry, I'm late. I picked up the cake and it took me longer than I expected. When will the party start?
#Person2#: Ben invited eight children from school. And they'll arrive at about 2 in the afternoon.
#Person1#: OK. Then I'll put the candles on the cake and leave it in the kitchen and then I'll come and help set the table."
"#Person1#: I'm calling about your ad in today's paper for a secretary. Is the positions still available?

#Person1#: Two o'clock is fine. Thank you very much."
"#Person1#: Good morning, you look very tired.
#Person2#: Yes, I nearly didn't sleep last night.
#Person1#: Did you hold a party or something else yesterday?
#Person2#: No, I just watched Supergirl, and it began too late in the night. I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock.
#Person1#: I don't like this program, because there are too many constant arguments between the judges.
#Person2#: The contestants are different. These girls perform in free styles.
#Person1#: Do you have much time watching TV?
#Person2#: I think less than 3 hours. This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs. Too many ads between the programs. I prefer listening to the radio.
#Person1#: I don't like ads, either. But ads could bring big profits to the TV station.
#Person2#: If they could make beautiful ads, I could bear."
"#Person1#: What are you doing, Victor?
#Person2#: I'm making a list of food and drinks.
#Person1#: What for?
#Person2#: What for? For the party, of course.
#Person1#: Party? What party?
#Person2#: We're having a Valentine's Day Party.
#Person1#: Oh, I forget. Who's invited?
#Person2#: We'Ve invited all our sophomore friends from school.

#Person2#: Thanks. See you at five. Don't forget to bring your valentine."
"#Person1#: Hello. Can I help you?
#Person2#: Yes. I'm here to apply for the job of director that your company posted yesterday. Is it still available?
#Person1#: Yes. We'll close this position posting at the end of this month.
#Person2#: Great. Where can I get an application form?
#Person1#: Go to the Human Resource Office, please. You can get it there.
#Person2#: Where is the Human Resource Office?
#Person1#: It's on the first floor, Room 120.
#Person2#: Thanks a lot.
#Person1#: Good luck.
#Person2#: I need it. Thank you."
"#Person1#: Did you hear that they are going to start an exercise class after work? 
#Person2#: Oh really? When is it going to start? 
#Person1#: Next month. I think. Are you going to sign up? 
#Person2#: Well, I'd like to, but I'm going to have to look at my schedule. "
"#Person1#: Can I help you, sir? 
#Person2#: I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind. But I can't find it. 
#Person1#: Let me give you a hand. The author is. . . 
#Person2#: Margaret Mitchell. 
#Person1#: Oh, yes. Here it is . 
#Person2#: Thank you very much. I have been looking for it for a long time. Is this the latest edition? 
#Person1#: Yes, we have both the paperback and hardcover. which would you want to buy? 
#Person2#: How about the price of the hardcover? 
#Person1#: It's $25. 
#Person2#: A little bit expensive, but I will buy one. This is $25 , here you are. "
"#Person1#: You didn't show up in the morning meeting. What's up?
#Person2#: Well, I just came in. I worked overtime yesterday. Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate. So I stayed to double check them. The boss was aware of my very late work of last night. So before he left office, he told me I could come one hour later this morning.
#Person1#: But you still look a little bit tired. What time did you leave?
#Person2#: It was around 1 thirty in the morning. I guess I didn't fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind. I just couldn't stop thinking about them.
#Person1#: That's normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.
#Person2#: Working at weekend is something I hate to do most.
#Person1#: But if the company asks, what else can we do?"
"#Person1#: Welcome to the McDonald's. What will it be for you, madam?
#Person2#: One Big Mac and French Fries.
#Person1#: Is there anything else?

#Person1#: Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him, but I don't know how to write it.
#Person2#: Don't worry. I know about this.
#Person1#: Really? Tell me without delay.
#Person2#: First you should have a salutation, which can be the company's or a person's name.
#Person1#: Well, I see.
#Person2#: Then you can write about his performance in college, including his academic achievements and his competence.
#Person1#: It's easy to write those.
#Person2#: You can also state his personality traits, hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on.
#Person1#: Tom got along well with classmates. He is really a good boy.
#Person2#: You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter.
#Person1#: What should I write except these?
#Person2#: You should also state that you are his class president, so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter
#Person1#: OK, I will remember."
"#Person1#: Can I help you?
#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here. What's today's rate of US dollar against the RMB yuan?
#Person1#: Let me see, the buying rate is RMB 808 per $ 100. How much would you like to change?
#Person2#: $ 200 altogether.
#Person1#: Would you mind showing me your passport?
#Person2#: Here it is. And how much RMB shall I get?
#Person1#: Let me see. $ 200 makes RMB 1, 616. Here is the cash and exchange memo. Please check it.
#Person2#: That's correct. Thank you very much."
"#Person1#: What can I do for you? 
#Person2#: I am trying to find this book. 
#Person1#: What's the problem? 
#Person2#: It doesn't seem like this library has it. 
#Person1#: Have you checked the computer? 
#Person2#: I have already. 
#Person1#: What did it say? 
#Person2#: It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there. 
#Person1#: I can always borrow the book from another library. 
#Person2#: You can do that? 
#Person1#: I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in. 
#Person2#: That's fantastic. Thank you. "
"#Person1#: Hotlines are very common in today's life, do you think so?
#Person2#: Of course.
#Person1#: Most of them are about amusement, in my opinion. But some of them are very important in our daily life.
#Person2#: Is that true?
#Person1#: Certainly. A free hotline offering help to teenagers was opened in Guangdong.
#Person2#: Can you tell me something more about it?
#Person1#: It is the first part of the national hotline system to help to protect teens' rights. Young people who have psychological problems or questions on legal issues can call for help. More than 100 experts are ready to offer help.
#Person2#: Then what is the telephone number?
#Person1#: Call 12355 if you are in Guangzhou and 020 12355 if you are outside.
#Person2#: Oh, it will be a help to teenagers."
"#Person1#: It seems the restaurants here have little business these days.
#Person2#: That's true. But ours is a scenic resort. And this is not the busy season. When summer comes, you'll see armies of tourists waiting in line in order to get a seat."
"#Person1#: Miss, where do you want to go?
#Person2#: Could you drop me off at the airport?
#Person1#: No problem.
#Person2#: Do I need to pay any extra charge for my suitcases?
#Person1#: Yes, you are charged 50 cents a piece.
#Person2#: All right."
"#Person1#: Hey, Robert, that's a nice shirt you are wearing. Where did you get it?
#Person2#: Thanks, I like it too. I bought it at the nearby department store.
#Person1#: That's nice. Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price?
#Person2#: Yeah, I know that. But at those places. the prices they ask you are ridiculously high, and if you don't bargain hard, you will get ripped-off.
#Person1#: True, learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time.
#Person2#: Yeah, but personally I hate bargaining. If I bargain, I might come to a lower price. But I will never know the true price of what I am buying, and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places.
#Person1#: Yeah, I have the same feeling. Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality. Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed. But at a wholesale market, you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not.
#Person2#: That's why I like department stores more. Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to.
#Person1#: I understand. While it's always good to follow the local customs, I guess there are exceptions."
"#Person1#: what date is it today?
#Person2#: why?
#Person1#: look at the girls in the street. They all have bunch of flowers. Is it Valentine's Day?
#Person2#: Oh, yes! I completely forgot about it.

#Person2#: no, but now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?
#Person1#: come on, dear! You forgot it, too.
#Person2#: you know, it's OK for a girl to forget these ' big days ', but for a guy, to do that is unforgivable.
#Person1#: is that your phone?
#Person2#: oh, it's Jack. Excuse me.
#Person1#: wow! good timing.
#Person2#: he asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us?
#Person1#: come on! three's a crowd!
#Person2#: so what?
#Person1#: just go! it's Valentine's Day!"
"#Person1#: Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon?
#Person2#: No I'm afraid not. I'm meeting Ruth then. How about the fourteenth in the morning?
#Person1#: I'm sorry. I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then.
#Person2#: What about the next day?
#Person1#: No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon?
#Person2#: Yes, I think I am. Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant.
#Person1#: Good idea! Is two o'clock okay?
#Person2#: That's fine. See you there!"
"#Person1#: Hi, Julia, it's Robert. How are you? I didn't see you in class today and I wondered if you were alright.
#Person2#: Oh yes, I'm better now, but I decided to take the day off as I woke up with a slight cold. It's really so nice you called.
#Person1#: Julia, I got you a copy of the main points of the lecture. It was just an introduction to French impressionist paintings.
#Person2#: I see. I can read it then before the next class.
#Person1#: Uh Julia, I'm calling as I wonder if you are free on Saturday night. My friend Max is having a party and I'd like to know if you want to go.
#Person2#: That would be really nice. I'll be free then. What time shall we go?
#Person1#: How about meeting in the student union bar at 7:00 o'clock?
#Person2#: That'll be fine, but shouldn't we buy a present for Max?
#Person1#: Well, we can stop at a gift shop on the way.
#Person2#: Fine. I'll see you then."
"#Person1#: Hi, what're you reading?
#Person2#: An old book Death on the Nile. Have you read it?
#Person1#: Not yet, but I saw the movie. Could I borrow it when you finish reading?
#Person2#: Sure. But you need to be patient."
"#Person1#: Hey! How was your first day of class? I'm in level two and I'm loving my class this semester! It's great being in a class of international students!
#Person2#: Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.
#Person1#: That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian,
#Person2#: That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and o
#Person1#: Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
#Person2#: I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.
#Person1#: Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.
#Person2#: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.
#Person1#: Well, there is that, yes."
"#Person1#: Have we sold out all the newspapers for today? 
#Person2#: Yes. What a good job we have done! 
#Person1#: Why are so many extra gifts left here? 
#Person2#: Many customers didn't want them. 
#Person1#: How about giving them to that old man? 
#Person2#: Good idea. 
#Person1#: By the way, do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers? 
#Person2#: I'm not sure, but still it did attract a large crowds today. 
#Person1#: I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper. 
#Person2#: But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around. 
#Person1#: That's true. 
#Person2#: Anyway, let's just finish out job and get back home. 
#Person1#: Okay. How tiring the job is! "
"#Person1#: May I help you?
#Person2#: I have a problem.
#Person1#: What's your problem?
#Person2#: I owe fees, but a bank statement never came in the mail about it.
#Person1#: I apologize for the inconvenience.
#Person2#: I have no idea about the fee, so my fees went up.
#Person1#: I understand your problem.
#Person2#: Will you be able to solve my problem?
#Person1#: I'm going to cancel the fees you owe.
#Person2#: So, I don't have to pay any of it?
#Person1#: The initial fee still must be paid.
#Person2#: That's fabulous. Thank you very much."
"#Person1#: so, your friend's getting married on Saturday. What have you bought her as a wedding gift. I find is so hard to choose the right gift.
#Person2#: my friend and her fiance had a really good idea. They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook. The picture are of things they want. People sign their name b
#Person1#: that's clever! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there's no chance of two people buying the same gift. What things were in the notebook?
#Person2#: most of the things were household appliance. You know, everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker. I think it's an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help
#Person1#: so, what did you get them?
#Person2#: I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems.
#Person1#: what's wrong with is?
#Person2#: she says that after several years of use, it's not working properly. When she uses it, it makes a funny noise.
#Person1#: household appliance don't seem to last for a long time nowadays.
#Person2#: I think it's because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models. Because they know that we will buy the new models, the appliances don't need to last more than five or ten year"
"#Person1#: Have you any round-neck sweater?
#Person2#: Yes. Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available.
#Person1#: Can I try this one on?
#Person2#: Sure, go ahead.
#Person1#: The color is too bright. For my age, I would prefer a lighter color."
"#Person1#: Oh, Christina, is that you? How have you been?
#Person2#: I've been okay. I've just been busy with school. We really should get together and have a chat. How about joining me for dinner tonight?
#Person1#: I'd love to, but I'm leaving for Miami at 8 tonight because my brother is getting married on Saturday morning.
#Person2#: Congratulations! I hope that you have a nice time there.
#Person1#: Well, what are you doing now? Maybe we can go to the coffee shop and chat for a while.
#Person2#: I really wish I could, but I'm on my way to the tennis courts.
#Person1#: Tennis courts? I didn't know you could play tennis.
#Person2#: I'm taking tennis lessons. My roommate is on a tennis team and she's gotten me interested in the sport. Do you know how to play?
#Person1#: A little, but I haven't played for years. When I come back from my trip, I'll join you in taking lessons.
#Person2#: It's a deal. Just give me a call when you get back.
#Person1#: You got it."
"#Person1#: Oh, hi, Linda. I'm glad I've caught you.
#Person2#: Hi, Chris.
#Person1#: I'm having a party this Saturday. I've just moved into a new flat. We're starting at about five thirty. Can you come?
#Person2#: I'd love to. Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Here's my new address.
#Person2#: Thanks. Church Street, Randwick.
#Person1#: Right. The party's at five thirty p.m.
#Person2#: I won't forget, and I'll be there in time.
#Person1#: See you then.
#Person2#: Bye."
"#Person1#: When can we expect you for dinner? Can you come tonight?
#Person2#: Not tonight. I promised to go to a concert with my sister.
#Person1#: Well. . . How about Friday then?
#Person2#: That sounds fine.
#Person1#: Good. Shall we say seven o'clock?
#Person2#: I'll be there. You're still a fabulous cook, aren't you?
#Person1#: That'll be for you to decide. I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you.
#Person2#: I'm ready. I'll look forward to it all Friday!"
"#Person1#: Steven, what are you thinking about?
#Person2#: Oh, you know, tomorrow is Vicky's birthday. I am thinking what gift to give her.
#Person1#: That's easy. A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments. How about a hair pin?
#Person2#: It's a bad idea. Vicky has short hair.
#Person1#: Well, what about a brooch?
#Person2#: Only old women like that.
#Person1#: Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday.
#Person2#: OK. That's what I can do."
