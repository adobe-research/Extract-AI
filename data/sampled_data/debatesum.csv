"It is open season for partisan gerrymandering after the Supreme Court in Rucho v. Common Cause ruled in a 5-4 decision that partisan gerrymandering was a non-justiciable “political question.” Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484, 204 L.Ed.2d 931 (2019). The Court dealt with two consolidated cases involving voters and other plaintiffs from North Carolina and Maryland alleging that both states’ congressional districting maps were unconstitutionally gerrymandered based on partisan lines. In North Carolina the plaintiffs claimed that the state’s districting plan diluted the votes of Democrats, and in Maryland the plaintiffs claimed that the state’s districting plan diluted the votes of Republicans. There was no question that both states’ legislatures engaged in the practice of partisan gerrymandering. As one of the two Republicans chairing the redistricting committee stated, “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So, I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.” Rucho v. Common Cause, 318 F. Supp. 3d 777, 809 (MDNC 2018). The same Republican also stated that the map was drawn with the aim of electing ten Republicans and three Democrats because he did “not believe it [would be] possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 3 Democrats.” Id. at 808. Despite the fact that Democratic candidates received more votes statewide, nine Republicans and three Democrats were elected with one election still pending. Rucho, 139 S. Ct. 2491-92. Similarly, the Democratic governor of Maryland testified that his aim was to “use the redistricting process to change the overall composition of Maryland’s congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican by flipping” one district. Id. The plaintiffs alleged that the partisan gerrymandering violated the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Elections Clause, and article I, §2, of the Constitution. In both of the cases, the lower courts found for the plaintiffs."
"On July 21, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 13806 on Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States. The EO directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a whole-of-government effort to assess risk, identify impacts, and propose recommendations in support of a healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base – a critical aspect of economic and national security. The EO 13806 effort was initiated by the White House Office of Trade & Manufacturing Policy led by the Department of Defense’s Office of Industrial Policy in coordination with the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Energy, and Homeland Security, and in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade & Manufacturing Policy. America’s manufacturing and defense industrial base (“the industrial base”) supports economic prosperity and global competitiveness, and arms the military with capabilities to defend the nation. Currently, the industrial base faces an unprecedented set of challenges: sequestration and uncertainty of government spending; the decline of critical markets and suppliers; unintended consequences of U.S. Government acquisition behavior; aggressive industrial policies of competitor nations; and the loss of vital skills in the domestic workforce. Combined, these challenges – or macro forces – erode the capabilities of the manufacturing and defense industrial base and threaten the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to be ready for the “fight tonight,” and to retool for great power competition. The following report explains the macro forces impacting the industrial base, identifies primary categories of risk, illustrates impacts within sectors, and provides recommendations for mitigation."
"Our assessment of existing transatlantic S&T cooperation and potential future applications of AI technologies has highlighted three sectors where US-EU collaboration on AI could be easily expanded. AI innovation and applications in the areas of healthcare, environmental sciences, and defense will be critical for the advancement of the “global good.”"
"India has a growing cyberspace capability, which, like that of many other nations, appears to have been used against potential foes, such as China and Pakistan, and more friendly states, like the United States. India is in the midst of deploying a Centralised (or Central) Monitoring System (CMS) that is designed to track all communications within India-telephone, computer, landline, mobile, and so on. Unlike the NSA program, CMS will not have to ask providers' permission for access but will have that built into the technology of the telecom and data service providers. (IMS will provide intelligence to foreign and domestic agencies, the police, and tax collectors-a list that some believe is too broad. Like the NSA program, CMS appears to focus on metadata. CMS is being developed and will be run by a government technology development center that is not part of the intelligent complex. The Ministry for Home Affairs will have the power to determine who is monitored."
"This elitism is a hallowed tradition of the European avant-garde. For decades, radical intellectuals have adopted dissident politics, aesthetics and morals to separate themselves from the majority of 'herd animals' whose minds were controlled by bourgeois ideologies. Despite their revolutionary rhetoric, avant-garde intellectuals fantasised about themselves as an artistic aristocracy ruling the philistine masses. Following this elitist custom, the Deleuzoguattarians champion nomadic minorities from the 'non-guaranteed' social movements against the stupified majority from the 'guaranteed'sector. Once again, the revolution is the ethical-aesthetic illumination of a minority rather than the social liberation of all people. Earlier in this century, this dream of an artistic aristocracy sometimes evolved into fascism. More often, the avant-garde supported totalitarian tendancies within the Left. Nowadays, cultural elitism can easily turn into implicit sympathy with neo-liberalism. The European avant-garde - and its imitators - could never openly support the free market fundamentalism of the Californian ideology. Yet, as TJs cut 'n' mix, the distinctions between right and left libertarianism are blurring. On the one hand, the Californian ideologues claim that a heroic minority of cyber-entrepreneurs is emerging from the fierce competition of the electronic marketplace. On the other hand, the Deleuzoguattarians believe that this new elite consists of cool TJs and hip artists who release subversive 'assemblages of enunciation' into the Net. In both the Californian ideology and Deleuzoguattarian discourse, primitivism and futurism are combined to produce the apotheosis of individualism: the cyborg Nietzschean Superman."
"Don’t let the “red alerts,” smog-shrouded buildings or blotted-out sun fool you: Beijing and China on the whole appear to be gaining real ground in the war on pollution."
"Transboundary river treaties and international conflict While this study is motivated by the premise that water scarcity can contribute to militarized international conflict, we echo some of the skepticism regarding the ‘water wars’ scenario. As Salehyan (2008) observes, proponents of the deterministic view that environmental scarcity leads to armed conflict tend to overlook the role of human agency and the moderating effects of institutions. International institutions, in particular, are one important factor that helps explain why international conflicts over water are comparatively rare. Rather than simply being the opposite of conflict, formal international cooperation is one method for managing transboundary water sources and thereby preventing the emergence and escalation of international water disputes. We thus view international institutions as critical explanatory variables that have been largely overlooked in many discussions of international water conflict. 5 International treaties have become an increasingly common means of managing transboundary rivers. International organizations, such as the United Nations and World Bank, often advocate the formation of river treaties. In the case of tensions in the Aral Sea basin, for example, the UN Secretary General has recommended a formal international accord to better manage the rivers feeding the Aral Sea (Heintz, 2010). This trend has been reflected in recent academic research investigating the conditions leading to river treaty formation (e.g. Tir & Ackerman, 2009; Stinnett & Tir, 2009; Tir & Stinnett, 2011). River treaties can specify how the river will be shared, set water quality targets, determine acceptable water withdrawal rates, or balance navigation, water level, and water quality needs; this will, in turn, help minimize the stresses placed on the river and make use more effective in the long run. By helping to resolve the underlying problems that occur because of the competing use of rivers – and which are likely to be exacerbated by increased water scarcity – treaties can alleviate political tensions and reduce international conflict (Wolf, Yoffe & Giordano, 2003)."
"Relatedly, many individuals and companies in the fishing industry across the nation are witnessing their business deplete right in front of them.387 This business failure is not due to a lack of demand for fish and seafood; instead, pollution is literally killing the market.388 Many fishermen and fishing companies in the Chesapeake Bay area are being forced to close their businesses because of the vast amount of pollutants in the bay water.389 The decline in water quality has directly resulted in a decline in the number of oysters, crabs, clams, and fish.390"
"Space power as a theory illustrates the importance of strategic space systems and demonstrates that space is the “ultimate high ground” in which policy makers and commanders will need to formulate actions to seize and control in support of strategic objectives. Theoretically, on-orbit offensive space capabilities would be used to find, fix, track, and destroy targets in space, air, on land and at sea. Again, if this capability existed, the employment of space weapons would be more of a combat multiplier in support of the other geographical mediums rather than providing unilateral control of all environments from space. Gray contends that space power “adds the greatest value for lethality in combat in the twentieth century.” 22 However, since most of the United States’ current offensive space power capabilities are ground-based and augmented with superior conventional as well as other non-kinetic weapons and forces, one could argue that we currently control the space medium without the cost, proliferation and hazards associated with placing weapon systems in orbit. Gray believes that the strategic interest in terms of space power theory “lies in the consequences of its application for deterrence and the conduct of war as a whole.” 2 The concept of space control put forth by Gray compares the control of the space medium as similar to conducting blockades and ‘choke points’ like Mahan’s maritime strategy for sea power. Space has similar choke points such as specific launch sites attempting to launch offensive space weapons or satellites that are susceptible to attack or that can be held at risk. 24 Again, these choke points or space blockades can be affected using existing capabilities without the need for placing weapons in space. The naval theories of Sir Julian Corbett are probably more fitting when considering a space power theory based on the control of space. Corbett emphasized the “conditional nature” of sea control. He believed that the conditional nature could be positive and defined as one’s ability to travel the seas freely. Corbett also believed that the conditional nature could be negative or the ability to deny this freedom to the enemy. It could either be local or global, permanent or temporary. This theory is very similar and applicable to the strategy of space control. 25"
"The litigation strategies developed by this Paper have been shown to sufficiently state a claim against major actors in the animal agriculture industry for their role in climate change.260 Although precedent has not yet been able to reach an analysis of the merits— let alone obtain a judgment—against climate change violators, by distinguishing from such cases the procedural hurdles they tackled with may be avoidable.261 Clearly, this Paper could not cover every foreseeable procedural challenge.262 However, it was able to distinguish from the problems that the most similar cases have faced thus far.263 The Fossil Fuel Litigation is still ongoing in the court system and the plaintiffs are currently fighting multiple procedural challenges.264 Following the failures and successes of their arguments can provide guidance to getting to the merits in the Animal Agriculture Litigation.265 If an analysis of the merits could be reached, this Paper has shown that, at least under California law, a strong argument for liability against the Beef and Dairy Defendants can be made.266"
"Over the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will lead the country until an election is called within 30 days. At this point, there is a massive amount of uncertainty behind the scenes. Uncertainty is dangerous in a market such as oil. Supply lines around the world are quite tight. This means that a disruption along the supply chain would have a severe impact on oil prices internationally. In the long run, it would be quite beneficial if a market-oriented leader emerged. This would provide long-term investing opportunities for businesses that can provide technological expertise as well as experience in helping to extract the abundance of various commodities from the ground. This would help keep oil prices relatively low. However, I think the transition period will be quite volatile. Remember that a lot of international companies had their assets seized by the Venezuelan government. While there is the potential for long-term investing opportunities, I’m not sure international companies would be willing to take a chance on a country that has shown disrespect for the law in the past. In addition, it is commonly known that the Venezuelan oil industry is poorly run. A shift in power might add confusion, which might increase the chances of a disruption in production, leading to volatility in oil prices. It would be beneficial for Americans to have a leader that could help Venezuelans by allowing international firms with modern technology to help develop the vast wealth within that nation. But this could create long-term investing opportunities for companies that could provide advanced skills and knowledge. This could also keep oil prices in check, creating a vast supply of oil between Venezuela, the U.S., and Canada."
"It is perhaps an irony of history that the answer to this problem of overinundation and data surplus appeared to be a turn to cybernetics, new models of networked cognition, and ultimately perhaps even a new model of machine learning that might indeed learn from the distributed intelligence of millions, and now billions, of people. At the same time, such technologies make it impossible to encounter the very legitimate sources of pain in contemporary societies whether induced by structural racism, poverty, disease, or environmental degradation."
"The Latino electorate played a decisive role in key U.S. Senate races in 2020 and will again be crucial in determining outcomes in the 2022 midterm elections, according to a report published today by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute. The report analyzes the choices of Latinos in 2020 Senate elections in five states where Latino voters were pivotal either because of their large numbers or the part they played in close races: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico and Texas. And with an eye toward 2022’s most contested races, the authors spotlight the frequency with which Latinos selected one party’s candidate for president and another’s for the Senate. In all these states, the authors found, Latino voters supported Democratic Senate candidates by wide margins in 2020. In Arizona, Colorado and Georgia, they voted for Democratic Senate candidates over Republican candidates by a 3-to-1 margin, and in New Mexico and Texas by a 2-to-1 margin. Yet despite this overwhelming support for Democratic Senate candidates, a considerable number of Latino voters — between 2% and 10%, depending on the state — split their ballots between parties when choosing Senate and presidential candidates in 2020. These swing voters will likely be a critical segment in this year’s midterm elections, particularly in states like Arizona and Georgia where Senate races are currently considered toss-ups, the authors said. Importantly, determining the future balance of power in the currently divided Senate and elsewhere will depend heavily on Latino voter turnout efforts, especially continued investments by all political parties in direct voter engagement and mobilizations by political campaigns, said the institute’s founding director, Sonja Diaz. “Voting patterns show the critical role Latinos play in pivotal midterm elections, but these votes must be earned,” Diaz said. “Campaigns for House and Senate seats should ensure they are reaching the Latino electorate by addressing the needs of this community and utilizing tailored outreach techniques proven to result in voter mobilization.”"
"Government officials sometimes describe a kind of Hieronymus Bosch landscape when warning of the possibility of a cyber attack on the electric grid. Imagine, if you will, that the United States is blindsided by an epic hack that interrupts power for much of the Midwest and mid-Atlantic for more than a week, switching off the lights, traffic signals, computers, water pumps, and air conditioners in millions of homes, businesses, and government offices. Americans swelter in the dark. Chaos reigns! ¶ Here's another nightmare scenario: An electric grid that serves two-thirds of a billion people suddenly fails in a developing, nuclear-armed country with a rich history of ethnic and religious conflict. Rail transportation is shut down, cutting off travel to large swathes of the country, while many miners are trapped underground. ¶ Blackouts on this scale conjure images of civil unrest, overwhelmed police, crippled hospitals, darkened military bases, the gravely injured in the back of ambulances stuck in traffic jams. ¶ The specter of what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called a ""digital Pearl Harbor"" led to the creation of U.S. Cyber Command, which is tasked with developing both offensive and defensive cyber warfare capabilities, and prompted FBI Director Robert Mueller to warn in March that cyber attacks would soon be ""the number one threat to our country."" Similar concerns inspired both the Democrats and Republicans to sound the alarm about the cyber threat in their party platforms. ¶ But are cyber attacks really a clear and present danger to society's critical life support systems, capable of inflicting thousands of casualties? Or has fear of full-blown cybergeddon at the hands of America's enemies become just another feverish national obsession -- another of the long, dark shadows of the 9/11 attacks? ¶ Worries about a large-scale, devastating cyber attack on the United States date back several decades, but escalatedfollowing attacks on Estonian government and media websites during a diplomatic conflict with Russia in 2007. That digital ambush was followed by a cyber attack on Georgian websites a year later in the run-up to the brief shooting war between Tbilisi and Moscow, as well as allegations of a colossal, ongoing cyber espionage campaign against the United States by hackers linked to the Chinese army. ¶ Much of the concern has focused on potential attacks on the U.S. electrical grid. ""If I were an attacker and I wanted to do strategic damage to the United States...I probably would sack electric power on the U.S. East Coast, maybe the West Coast, and attempt to cause a cascading effect,"" retired Admiral Mike McConnell said in a 2010 interview with CBS's 60 Minutes. ¶ But the scenarios sketched out above are not solely the realm of fantasy. This summer, the United States and India were hit by two massive electrical outages -- caused not by ninja cyber assault teams but by force majeure. And, for most people anyway, the results were less terrifying than imagined. ¶ First, the freak ""derecho"" storm that barreled across a heavily-populated swath of the eastern United States on the afternoon of June 29 knocked down trees that crushed cars, bashed holes in roofs, blocked roads, and sliced through power lines. ¶ According to an August report by the U.S. Department of Energy, 4.2 million homes and businesses lost power as a result of the storm, with the blackout stretching across 11 states and the District of Columbia. More than 1 million customers were still without power five days later, and in some areas power wasn't restored for 10 days. Reuters put the death tollat 23 people as of July 5, all killed by storms or heat stroke. ¶ The second incident occurred in late July, when 670 million people in northern India, or about 10 percent of the world's population, lost power in the largest blackout in history. The failure of this huge chunk of India's electric grid was attributed to higher-than-normal demand due to late monsoon rains, which led farmers to use more electricity in order to draw water from wells. Indian officials told the media there were no reports of deaths directly linked to the blackouts. ¶ But this cataclysmic event didn't cause widespread chaos in India -- indeed, for some, it didn't even interrupt their daily routine. ""[M]any people in major cities barely noticed the disruption because localized blackouts are so common that many businesses, hospitals, offices and middle-class homes have backup diesel generators,"" the New York Timesreported. ¶ The most important thing about both events is what didn't happen. Planes didn't fall out of the sky. Governments didn't collapse. Thousands of people weren't killed. Despite disruption and delay, harried public officials, emergency workers, and beleaguered publics mostly muddled through. ¶ The summer's blackouts strongly suggest that a cyber weapon that took down an electric grid even for several days could turn out to be little more than a weapon of mass inconvenience.¶ That doesn't mean the United States can relax. James Lewis, director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes that hackers threaten the security of U.S. utilities and industries, and recently penned an op-ed for the New York Times calling the United States ""defenseless"" to a cyber-assault. But he told Foreign Policy the recent derecho showed that even a large-scale blackout would not necessarily have catastrophic consequences."
"Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and cyber crime are in the headlines as significant threats to our national security. However, over the next twenty to thirty years, America’s overwhelming dependence on oil presents subtler, although no less serious, threats to national security. The U.S. is the largest consumer of oil in the world, burning through 18.83 million barrels per day. Even if the U.S. produced all petroleum products domestically, Americans would still feel the shocks from market volatility. Oil is a global market, and market prices prevail regardless of origin. Despite policies to improve vehicle efficiency, America remains dependent on oil. This dependency presents several threats to U.S. national security. First, oil price volatility hampers American productivity and consumers. Economic vitality requires stable prices, as spikes in oil prices may reduce output and wages while increasing inflation and interest rates. Most commonly, consumers feel these disruptions at the gas pump. The transportation sector alone consumes 13.223 million barrels of petroleum per day. Petroleum facilitates the functioning of these critical transportation networks, and small disruptions may lead to cascading price dumps. As volatile oil prices destabilize the economy, they jeopardize U.S. interests and national security. Secondly, U.S. oil dependency distorts foreign policy. The U.S. imported 40% of its petroleum products in 2012. In order to ensure foreign oil security, the U.S. supports regimes it might not otherwise. Many oil-rich Islamist regimes in the Middle East receive de facto support from America in return for producing stable oil, despite conflicting ideologies and interests. Similarly, estimates show that extended military operations to guard oil supply lines cost the U.S. military $67.5-$83 billion per year. This dependency is costly and conflicts with the national security agenda. Lastly, oil dependency undermines military preparedness and effectiveness. The Department of Defense consumed 117 million barrels of oil in 2011 in order to fuel the military’s vehicles, ships, and planes. The military must complete its missions, and without fuel options, it must endure oil price fluctuations. For every 25-cent increase per barrel of oil, the Department of Defense pays an additional $1 billion in fuel costs per year. Additional fuel costs means the military has to cut costs elsewhere, which have negative impacts on security and military preparedness. Military energy security requires reduced consumption of petroleum products, yet the Department of Defense depends on oil for 80% of its energy needs. The military may reduce consumption by reforming energy-intensive activities, optimizing energy usage, and developing innovative technologies to reduce energy waste, but sequestration budget cuts will slash future investment. Instead of focusing solely on drilling for more oil, the U.S. must pursue a two-pronged approach that focuses on reducing oil demand while at the same time makes investments in developing alternative fuels. Clean energy technologies could cut imports by 44% which is nearly eight times more than potential domestic drilling production. Greater efforts to improve vehicle efficiency through corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE), congestion charges, or fuel taxes can contribute to reducing oil consumption. Moreover, America’s oil dependence saps the U.S. economy because consumers lack fuel options. To that end, investments in alternative sources of fuel – biofuels, natural gas, electric vehicles – can act as a hedge against oil price volatility. Throughout 2012, the U.S. spent $4.36 billion on energy research, which fell well below IEA recommendations. Due to budget caps and sequestration, energy research funding will drop substantially over the next few years. Oil dependency is a long-term threat. The rising cost of oil dependence affects all aspects of American society and threatens national security. If the U.S. wishes to reduce these threats in the future, the U.S. must properly fund energy research and development to commercialize technologies that will break America’s oil dependency. Only then can we say we have actually achieved energy security."
"A second set of changes concerns the character of the law of nations itself. That law once primarily governed the relations of states to one another, but it now also concerns the relations of states to their own citizens, 37 as well as a host of commercial, environmental, and other matters. 38 These concerns extend well beyond the traditional matters of war and peace upon which Professors Bellia and Clark focus, and it is far from clear that the judicial power that Bellia and Clark recognize to incorporate the law of nations ought to extend to the far broader modern sweep of international law. As Bellia and Clark probably recognize, judicial application of this modern international law often will not protect political branch prerogatives, and it may in fact undermine those prerogatives. Moreover, the modern law of nations is formed in quite different ways than the international law known to the Framers. This is true not only of CIL, which is now more a creature of world opinion than a reflection of nations' actual practice, 39 but also of multilateral treatymaking and international norms promulgated by supranational institutions exercising delegated lawmaking power. Parallel changes have affected the enforcement of international law. Breaches of the modern law of nations may be addressed not simply by the aggrieved nation, but by a variety of multilateral institutions, and the range of possible punishments includes trade sanctions and a variety of other measures short of war. Whatever the felt necessity for federal  [*38]  judicial incorporation of the law of nations when few alternative enforcement mechanisms existed to avoid the use of military force by some other nation, under current circumstances such unilateral judicial action is both less pressing and more likely to complicate the working out of international disputes through other political and legal mechanisms."
"Now an argument can be made that  if the half-century of political  paralysis on this issue can be overcome, both Cuba and the United States would benefit. American tourists would most likely pour into Cuba, buying cigars, staying in beachfront hotels — spending money in the Cuban economy. And American businesses would find an eager new market for a range of products beyond the food and medicine they are already authorized to sell.¶ “We cannot afford an obsolete ideological war against Cuba,” Richard Slatta, a history professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in Latin America, wrote in an op-ed last month. “The embargo against Cuba denies North Carolina businesses and farmers access to a major, proximate market.”¶ Cuba experts say many business leaders, particularly, are making the same case, especially now that the American economy has remained in the doldrums for so long. They add that  it’s an obvious second-term issue; Obama doesn’t have to worry about winning Florida again.¶ But for so many people in Washington, “Cuba doesn’t matter any more now,” said Ted Piccone, deputy director for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution and a former National Security Council official. “There’s no political incentive” to change the policy — even though the arguments for changing it are rife. Despite ample provocation, the U.S. doesn’t impose similar embargoes on other authoritarian states."
"In 1924, a new quota system was instituted, based on national origin, that severely limited immigration from southern and eastern Europe. In the debate leading up to this legislation, disability figured prominently. Quota advocates warned that particular nationalities were disproportion ately prone to be mentally defective. Rhetoric about ""the slow-witted Slav,"" the poor physique of Jews, the ""neurotic condition of our Jewish immi grants,"" and the ""degenerate and psychopathic types, which are so con spicuous and numerous among the immigrants,"" was pervasive.27 Restrictionists emphasized the inferior appearance of recent immigrants. One avowed that ""the physiognomy of certain groups unmistakably proclaims inferiority of type."" When he observed immigrants, he saw that ""in every face there was something wrong_There were so many sugar-loaf heads, moon-faces, slit mouths, lantern-jaws, and goose-bill noses that one might imagine a malicious jinn had amused himself by casting human beings in a set of skew-molds discarded by the Creator."" Most were physically inade quate in some way: ""South Europeans run to low stature. A gang of Ital ian navvies filing along the street present, by their dwarfishness, a curious contrast to other people. The Portuguese, the Greeks, and the Syrians are, from our point of view, undersized. The Hebrew immigrants are very poor in physique ... the polar opposite of our pioneer breed.""28 The issues of ethnicity and disability were inextricably intertwined. While disability has been largely overlooked as a category of analysis in the literature on immigration, this is by no means unique to immigration studies. Disability is conspicuously absent from all fields of histories. In areas of study where disability is clearly central, such as the consequences of war, industrialization, and the rise of the automobile, even in the his tory of the eugenics movement, the literature has focused elsewhere, em phasizing better established categories of analysis such as race, gender, and class, and leaving disability unexamined at the periphery. When historians do take note of disability, they usually treat it merely as personal tragedy rather than a cultural construct to be questioned and explored.29 In immi gration historiography, as in so many other areas of historical inquiry, dis ability has long been present but rendered either invisible or insignificant. A disability analysis is essential, however, to making sense of the depth of anti-immigrant sentiment and the workings of immigration policy at the turn of the twentieth century. While it is certain that immigration restriction rested in good part on a fear of ""strangers in the land,"" in John Higham's phrase, it was fueled at least as much by a fear of defectives in the land."
"Also it has to be recognised that benefits may accrue from adding physical structure to the environment in some locations, as it provides a new, albeit artificial, reef habitat for organisms to settle on (such as filter feeders). Such structure tends to attract and concentrate fish. Monitoring of the Horns Rev wind farm demonstrated a 60-fold increase in available food biomass for fishxxxviii, whilst Reubens et al.xxxix found large aggregations of pouting and cod within a Belgian wind farm, a result confirmed by Lindeboom et al.xl in Dutch waters, who also recorded higher numbers of porpoise clicks within the wind farm and the varied responses of bird species. Higher benthic biomasses were recorded on turbines off Sweden, but with lower diversity compared with control reef structuresxli, explained by the lack of complexity on the monopiles. Fish abundance was greater in the vicinity of the turbines than surrounding areas, however, with similar diversity levels xlii. Langhamer and Wilhel mssonxliii demonstrated that populations of edible crab could be boosted within foundations for wave energy devices by enhanced engineering adding holes to the design. Provision of physical structure therefore results in increased benthic and fish biomass, though whether this is a concentration effect of fish or is a true boost to local populations is as yet unsure, in parallel with other artificial reef structures."
"It was not until the dawn of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954) that the underlying justification for institutional exclusion and segregation of Black students was broadly questioned as incompatible with the norms of liberal democracy. During this time, the university became one of the primary sites of struggle and social transformation. In “Black Study, Black Struggle,” Kelley recounts the rich tradition of Black studies as it emerged through the “mass revolt” of “insurgent intellectuals” committed to the development of “fugitive spaces” not just outside, but also in opposition to, the Eurocentric university. He cites the works of James Baldwin, Ella Baker, Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Barbara Smith, C. L. R. James, and Cedric Robinson, among others, as the “sources of social critique” that helped to inspire alternative spaces like the Mississippi Freedom Schools. The aim was not simply to offer a broader, more inclusive curriculum, but rather to design one that examined power along the axes of race and class, developing “trenchant critiques of materialism” that helped to challenge “the myth that the civil rights movement was just about claiming a place in mainstream society” (Kelley, 2016). The desire, as articulated by Kelley, was not for “equal opportunity in a burning house;” rather, “they wanted to build a new house.” But since the settler university can only “remove to replace,” it was not long before the revolutionary and redistributive aims of Black radicalism were supplanted by and absorbed within the political project of liberal pluralism, transposing the anti- capitalist critique with a politics of recognition. In other words, through the structures of settler logics, the demands of #ConcernedStudent1950 are only legible as the desire for recognition and more “intense inclusion” (Kelley, 2016). While demands for safe spaces, greater diversity, mental health counseling, curricular representation, and renamed campus buildings are hardly inconsequential, they also have the potential to function as inducements. Thus, just as recognition- based politics impede Indigenous struggles for decolonization, they also constrain efforts for more a radical vision for Black study and struggle within and against the university. In other words, the settler state has an array of strategies— recognition being one of them— to placate dispossessed people while evading any effort to change the underlying power structure. Despite all the handwringing by university officials, within the context of the liberal academy, discourses of recognition garner wide appeal as they provide a means for neatly bracketing what are fundamentally complex and ongoing sets of power relations. Such demands mark a definitive endpoint to a history of wrongdoing as well as a means for moving beyond that history (Corntassel & Holder, 2008). Consider, for example, the growing wave of colleges and universities seeking to reconcile their involvement in the slave trade. The University of Alabama (2004), the University of Virginia (2007), and Emory University (2011) have all issued formal apologies. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill erected a memorial, Washington and Lee removed all its confederate flags, and the College of William and Mary launched an investigation into its history of complicity. Brown University launched one of the most comprehensive projects that included a commissioned three- year study, an acknowledgement, a memorial, and an endowment for Providence public schools. While the symbolic importance of such projects should not be underestimated, they should also be understood as a first step toward restructuring material conditions. For example, consider that though it has been 15 years since the Brown study was launched, only 7.3% of their student body and 4% of its faculty are currently African- American. And, no institution to date has offered reparations.15 Nevertheless, recognition not only continues to serve as the dominant institutional framework for addressing structural racism but also, as noted by Kelley (2016, para. 7), student activists now parrot the discourses of recognition and thereby unwittingly participate in their own continued marginalization. A thematic analysis of the current compilation of student demands from across 70 institutions shows that 88% demanded either changes to curricula or diversity training (especially for faculty); 87% demanded more support for students of color (i.e., multicultural centers, residence halls, financial aid, mental health services); 79% demanded greater faculty diversity; and 24% desire apologies and acknowledgments. This breakdown suggests that the central organizing principal for demands is indeed the desire for a more “hospitable” institution. Yet, it isn’t so much the nature of the demands that Kelley takes issue with but rather their persistent framing through the discourses of personal trauma (emphasis in original) and the potential to “slip into” thinking about “ourselves as victims and objects rather than agents” (Kelley, 2016). In some instances, faculty have joined students, sometimes issuing their own demands for recognition. Most often, faculty demands are organized around issues of tenure, the exploitation of contingent faculty, and increasing violations of academic freedom, which disproportionately impact women and faculty of color."
"Whether the sensitivities of the Arctic littoral states to cooperation with the three non-littoral states, or mutual mistrust between Russia and the other states, will prevent such an architecture from being formed is the main unknown in Arctic security. For the time being, however, while there remains suspicion among some Arctic states – and occasional bouts of belligerent rhetoric and the procurement of some equipment, which suggests state-based rivalry – the reality is that the Arctic is not witnessing an uncontrolled or substantially competitive militarisation. It is a region that has inherent strategic value, given the patrols of ballistic-missile submarines, but it is also one in which operations are hampered by weather and geography. While Russian defence spending has increased rapidly, it is from a remarkably low base and investments are currently just rejuvenating an entirely dilapidated fleet. Most Nordic budgets are constrained by austerity, US defence priorities lie elsewhere and Canada’s primary Arctic-focused procurement is of vessels devoted to maritime security. There may be more military activity in the Arctic in the future, but it is currently far from being a battleground for rival states."
"Emergency systems Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems. That power is normally tapped off of the electricity that the reactor generates. If the plant is offline, the power is provided by the electrical grid. But what happens when the grid itself goes down? The short answer is that large on-site diesel generators automatically activate to provide electricity. And if those should fail, portable diesel generators, which are also on-site, can be connected. Recent standardization has also ensured that generators can be swapped between plants without the need to retrofit connectors. There are also a couple of additional emergency systems that can be used specifically to cool the reactor. These include the turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump, which uses steam generated by the reactor to power a cooling turbine. The pump requires an operator, but it runs completely without electricity. This system, however, is meant only for emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few days when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature, not for long-term cooling. And finally, in the worst case, most plants have a method of bringing in river or ocean water to flood the reactor. This typically damages the cooling system, but again, it helps to cool and cover the reactor core should all else fail. Unlike in other countries, permission from the federal government is not required to flood the reactor. Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems to the backup systems, it would seem that there’s nothing to worry about, right? Under all but the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct. However, one could imagine a scenario in which the grid was lost and the diesel generators ran out of fuel. Speaking of fuel, how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, there is enough fuel to run the emergency diesel generators for at least 42 days. I say at least because it would depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the reactor was cooled down, a much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System, would be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The generators and onsite fuel supply could power that smaller cooling system for significantly longer than if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system. Even if we assumed a worst case of 42 days, it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which that would not be enough time to bring in additional fuel either by land, water, or air. Nonetheless, let’s push the question a little further. What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel was exhausted? Even with the reactor having been successfully cooled, the biggest risk would continue to be overheating of the fuel rod assemblies, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. Without circulation, the heat from the fuel rod assemblies could boil the surrounding water, resulting in steam. In turn, the water levels would drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to air. Once exposed to air, their temperatures would rise but not to the levels that would melt the zirconium cladding. Thankfully, that means that meltdown would not occur. The steam might well carry radioactive contaminants into the air, but there would be no release of hydrogen and, thus, no subsequent explosions. The situation would certainly be dangerous to surrounding communities, but it wouldn’t be the nuclear Armageddon that many people worry about."
"The White House is assertively working to make America white again, and Democrats are too afraid to speak that truth. The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.The pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people. It should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration’s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. “By greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,” the economist Michael Clemens said.“Decades ahead,” he added, “many fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.”"
"Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, the NRC reviewed license applications for, and oversaw the construction, startup, and operation of, more than 100 commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States. Beginning in the 1980s and extending to today, the NRC also reviewed new plant designs and plans to increase the power output of operating reactors. As a result, the NRC has more collective experience than any other nuclear regulatory agency in the world.∂ Thanks to robust NRC regulation and its own initiatives, particularly including the INPO, the commercial nuclear power industry in the United States has accumulated an impressive record of operational and safety performance. Operational and technological improvements have enabled plant operators to dramatically boost performance over the last several decades. For example, in 1980 the average capacity factor for the commercial U.S. nuclear plant fleet as a whole was just 56.3 percent. This figure rose to 66 percent in 1990 and continued rising over the past two decades, reaching 89 percent in 2011.70∂ For decades, and continuing through today, the U.S. system of regulations and operational standards has been viewed as the best in the world. An NRC license for a particular reactor design has been viewed as the “gold standard” and has opened opportunities to market that design around the world.71 The desire to learn from U.S. regulatory and operational experiences is one of the factors that caused nations in the past to want to enter into agreements for nuclear cooperation with the United States, and it has given Washington an important edge in negotiating such agreements.∂ Cooperating with other countries on issues of nuclear safety, in turn, gives the United States an opportunity to shape behaviors in other areas, particularly with respect to plant security, materials safeguards, emergency response, and nonproliferation. Other leading supplier nations don’t always adhere to the same strict controls the United States has adopted in these areas. Maintaining an edge in the regulatory arena, however, will be difficult if our nation’s own commercial nuclear activities decline."
"All black people are involved in the struggle. Revolutionaries are not necessarily born poor or in the ghetto. There is a role for every person in revolution if he is revolutionary. You don’t have to throw a Molotov cocktail to be a revolutionary. One thing which the Black college student can do is to begin to legitimatize the brother’s actions - begin to articulate his position, because the college student has the skills that the blood doesn’t have. It reminds me of the old story about the father and his son. The son comes to the father and says, “You told me that the loin was the king of the jungle. Yet in every story I read, the man always beats the lion. Why is that?” The father looks at the son and says, “Son, the story will always end the same until the lion learns how to write.” If you don’t begin to tell your own story, you will always be Aunt Jemima; you will always be “rioting.” You must begin to articulate a position of your own. The Black college student, if he is revolutionary, can help Black people to purge themselves of the misinformation that they’ve been fed all lives. White nationalism has been instilled in us whether we know it or not. We have been told that George Washington is no hero of blacks. He had 13 children and none by Martha. They were slaves. They tell us we should celebrate Christopher Columbus was a 15th century Eisenhower. He was so dumb. He was trying to get to India Did you ever see where India is on a map?   But America has the power to legitimatize these people and make them heroes in our minds. America has negroes in the dilemma of thinking that everything black is bad. Black cows don’t give good milk. Black hens don’t lay eggs. Black mail is bad. You wear black to funerals and white to weddings. Angel food cake is white, devils food cake is black. And all good guys wear white hats. And black people fall for it. Everything black is bad. That’s white nationalism. And they tell you, you cant talk about black nationalism. So how do you combat it if you grow up telling your children that they respect Santa Claus. Come Dec 25 is santa claus is so white that he slides down a black chimney and comes out white. But you tell your children that santa claus brought these toys and you take them to see the white santa claus. So therefore it becomes instilled in their minds that santa claus is good because santa claus is white. Thus we help foster that type of white nationalism. You must begin to define for yourself; you must begin to define your black heritage. You must begin to investigate and learn on your own. They will never tell you that Hannibal is black. They’ll never tell you that there were black societies back in the 16th century and were the most modern at that time and the highest degree of their culture existed there. Every time you open a book here in America, they gonna show you uncle tom’s cabin or they gonna show you double O soul with a piece of watermelon. It is the responsibility of the black college student to combat this sort of thing. The education that a black student gets is irrelevant, fruitless and worthless unless he uses it to define and articulate positions that are relevant to the black people. It does you no good to come to school and cross the burning sand. Hell you aint never get off the burning sand. Pledging is no good for black people in America. When the man moves against you, your Omega sticker does not mean that he is going to pass you by. All it mean is he might take you to a different camp. If you must pledge, pledge to be a revolutionary. You are involved in the struggle whether you want to be or not. Your badge of involvement is your skin. Therefore, you got to quit walking around talking about those people out there acting crazy. Them!! That’s you!! Anything we do will have a profound impact on you."
"Despite the large increases in federal aid since the 1960s, public school academic performance has ultimately not improved. While scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress have improved for some groups and younger ages, math and reading scores for 17-year-olds—essentially, the school system’s “final products”—have been stagnant. In addition, America’s performance on international exams has remained mediocre, yet we spend more per-pupil on K-12 education than almost any other country.6 Federal funding and top-down rules are not the way to create a high-quality K-12 education system in America."
"Some of the “best” are working to bring down President Donald Trump, yet are they ready to cut to the chase? He has cards up his sleeve. He came to power partly because he won the support of working class and lower middle class whites who were prepared to vote against their economic interest for the sake of the nationalism that Trump espoused. Neither Keir Hardie nor Franklin Roosevelt nor Bernie Sanders were their leader. It was Trump. I don’t find it difficult to imagine how Trump could play the nationalist card that would rally his electorate. The “best” would be against this, but how many would be convinced enough to go out on the street, French style, and demand Congress impeach him? I doubt if the Harvard professors would or journalists from the New York Times, business men, school teachers, doctors, civil servants or airline pilots. Of course, as with the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War protests, there would be students in the front row. Then there would be clergy, a few professors from the University of Wisconsin, novelists, Senator Sanders and at most 50 members of Congress. The police would easily face them down and disperse them. “Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel”, said Samuel Johnson. So is extreme confrontation, or even war. What follows is not my scenario. It is that of Philip Gordon, writing in the current issue of the respected “Foreign Affairs”. He was Barack Obama’s Special Assistant for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf regions. Those who have dormant passionate intensity in their bones should read it and act now before it is too late. Events can move fast. “A week is a long time in politics”, said the former British prime minister, Harold Wilson. Trump could begin his diversionary tactics with Iran, his arch-enemy during the campaign. Gordon says, let’s suppose that a dozen Americans are killed in an attack in Iraq by an Iranian-supported militia. Two days later, Trump imposes further sanctions on Iran, effectively torpedoing the de-nuclearisation agreement negotiated by Obama. Iran continues to test its missiles. It steps up its support for the Syrian government. Later in the year, the situation having deteriorated further, Iran announces it will resume prohibited nuclear activities, including testing advanced centrifuges and expanding its stockpile of low-enrich uranium. Frustrated by continued Iranian support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Pentagon steps up patrols in the Strait of Hormuz and loosens the rules of engagement for U.S. forces. When an Iranian patrol boat aggressively approaches a U.S. cruiser, the ship fires and kills 25 Iranians. Revenge is swift and 6 more American soldiers in Iraq are killed. In return Trump authorises a cruise missile attack on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Nationalist fervour increases in Iran, and also in America. Iran lets its nuclear scientists off the leash. Next, U.S. bombers destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. A good chunk of the U.S. electorate cheers him on. Anti-Trump congressmen feel that they couldn’t continue with their effort to impeach him while America was in such a serious situation. Experts later called the confrontation with China the most dangerous one since the Cuban Missile Crisis that almost erupted into nuclear war. The president’s advisor, Steve Bannon, said at the beginning of the Administration: “We’re going to war in the South China Sea in five to ten years.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, pushed by Trump, warns that China’s access to the islands there “is not going to be allowed”. At the same time North Korea tests another long-range missile capable of reaching the western sea-board of the US. Trump demands that China pressure North Korea to stop the provocation or it would go to war with the North. China is worried about the mass of refugees that would pour into China if the regime collapsed. Also it doesn’t want U.S.-backed troops to advance to its border with the North. It refuses Trump. Trump then says the days of placating China are over. Sanctions are imposed. President Xi Jinping feels he has to retaliate. He imposes a 45% tariff on imports and sells $100 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds. Next follows an incident in the South China Sea, a clash between American and Chinese naval boats. Each side’s carriers are rushed to the region. There is a military stand-off that looks like stretching into the distant future. U.S.-China relations are in ruins. But Trump is off the hook for the rest of his term. During the next election? Perhaps war with North Korea."
"The United States, especially members of Congress, needs to remember that we have had at least as many military problems in fighting the Iraq and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have faced in fighting in Yemen. Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do little more that lead the Saudis to ignore the systems that the United States has helped set up to limit targeting of civilians and using unguided and more damaging air munitions. It raises a whole new round of questions about the U.S commitment to its partners in the region."
"A lot of people have been noting that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change will leave the US as one of just three non-participating countries in the world. We are nearly alone on this. Isolated. But I don't think this talking point means quite what people think it does. It was possible to get nearly every country in the world to join the agreement because the agreement does not really do anything. The agreement allows countries to set their own targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and it prescribes no way to enforce those targets. Since the agreement is fundamentally symbolic — an expression of global intent to combat climate change — Trump's choice to withdraw is similarly a symbol of his intent for the US to unencumber itself from international commitments. Compared to other international agreements that Trump complains about, Paris was easy to withdraw from. Doing so will not enrage key Republican political constituencies and will not produce much in the way of policy effects. As I wrote yesterday, the agreement may even be marginally more effective without us involved. Because of the agreement's non-binding nature, and because so many of the factors slowing the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions are outside the purview of Trump and Congress, our withdrawal probably will not even have a material effect on emissions or global temperatures. And that's why Trump left this agreement, rather than, say, NAFTA or NATO — binding agreements where withdrawal would impose tangible costs. For all of Trump's ""America first"" talk, and for all the radical ideas he has expressed about international relations, he is doing surprisingly little to change America's place in the international order. Withdrawing from Paris is performative isolationism; so far, Trump has chickened out of pursuing real isolationism. He considered starting the process to withdraw from NAFTA, but was talked out of it by his advisers. He instead pledged to renegotiate the agreement to get better deals at the margin — for example, on the sale of American dairy products to Canada — an issue that was also on President Obama's agenda, and that would have been addressed in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He rattled his saber at China, declaring his intention to beat them on trade and flirting with recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. But President Xi Jinping got Trump to back down on Taiwan by giving him the silent treatment. Then, Trump declared victory on Chinese trade after reaching a tiny, beef-for-chicken trade deal in which China got the better end of the stick. Trump claimed he didn't need to be too harsh on China because the Chinese had acquiesced to his demand that they stop artificially weakening their currency — a step the Chinese had actually taken years before he took office. If there is going to be a protectionist reimagining of America's trade policy under Trump, it is not yet in evidence. The steps he has taken so far — for example, imposing tariffs on softwood lumber — are within the realm of normal actions undertaken by past presidents who were broadly committed to free trade, like President George W. Bush. The president has done his part to weaken the NATO alliance with his words, or lack thereof, but so far we remain officially committed to the alliance. The president's advisers insist he is committed to NATO's Article V mutual-defense agreement, even if the president has been reluctant to say as much out loud. If Trump came into office intending to lift sanctions and reach détente with Russia, the widening scandal around his campaign — and the replacement of his pro-Russian national-security adviser Michael Flynn with a normal human being — seem to have discouraged him from doing so. It does look like the Russians may get their tennis club on the eastern shore of Maryland back; I doubt that was Vladimir Putin's top concern. Trump hasn't been able to retrench and realign the US in the ways he claims he wants to because the consequences would be too negative. Pulling out of NAFTA would shrink the US economy and cause the stock market to fall. Trump wants NATO for its help on anti-terror initiatives. Easing up too much on Russia right now would seem too fishy. By contrast, withdrawing from the Paris agreement is little more than a middle finger to the rest of the world. An obscene gesture, but a gesture nonetheless. The most tangible problem created by our withdrawal from the accord may be a decline in America's global standing and leadership. But I tend to think that decline is largely a function of Trump's presidency itself; America would hardly be seen as a leader on climate change under Trump if we had instead stayed in the accord and ignored our emissions targets. To the extent our withdrawal alienates the world from us, that aligns with Trump's intent in withdrawing, and does indeed make the US more isolated. But Trump has been reluctant to take more concrete and irrevocable isolating steps, for clear reasons."
"One major U.S. ally that has not yet made a decision as to whether to join is Japan. The Obama Administration is presumably still opposed to its participation; but whatever the merits of that position before other G7 members decided to come on board, it should be abandoned now. It is no longer in U.S. interests. Governance of the new AIIB has not yet been determined, although China is believed to support a 75%/25% voting split between Asian and non-Asian members, with voting shares within each group allocated according to gross domestic product (GDP). China also foreswore veto power, which the U.S. has within the IMF and World Bank, in order to persuade U.S. allies to join. With such a governance structure, China will be highly dominant within the organization – having 43% of the votes, nearly 5 times more than number 2 India (if current-dollar GDP determines voting power), as shown in the left-hand figure above. U.S. ally countries – the UK, Germany, France, and other European nations, and Australia and South Korea in the Asia-Pacific – would have only 28% of the vote. With Japan as a member, however, close U.S. allies would have 41% of the vote – more than China’s 35%, as shown in the right-hand figure above. Therefore, even if the United States chooses to remain outside the AIIB, it should, at this point – assuming that it wishes to temper China’s dominance – be encouraging Japan to join."
"Hillary Clinton's lead over presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has widened to 7 points nationally, according to a tracking poll released early Tuesday. Clinton leads Trump, 49 percent to 42 percent, among registered voters in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted last week. The polling was conducted as Clinton secured the number of delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and won the backing of top Democrats including President Obama. Meanwhile, Trump faced a barrage of criticism, including from top Republicans, over his comments on a federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University who he claimed was biased due to his Mexican heritage. Clinton's numbers have ticked upward in the poll since the end of May, while Trump's have inched downward, putting daylight between the two.  An increase in support among moderates, men and white voters contributed to Clinton's edge in the new poll. Clinton still gained on Trump when the poll factored in third-party candidates, too, with Clinton at 42 percent, Trump at 38 percent, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson at 9 percent and likely Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 5 percent. The survey of 10,604 adults, including 9,355 registered voters, was conducted online June 6–12. It has an overall margin of error of 1.4 percentage points."
"With the WikiLeaks hacks and other threats to cybersecurity present, guarding against cyberattacks has become a significant part of governing -- especially because most government agencies have moved to online systems. As a potential government shutdown comes closer, agencies must face new questions about defining “essential” computer personnel. Cyber threats weren’t as significant during the 1995 furlough as they are today, reports NextGov. The publication adds that agencies need to buck up and be organized. In late January, government officials, NATO and the European Union banded together in Brussels to formulate a plan to battle cyber bandits, according to Defense Systems. Leaders there agreed that existing cybersecurity measures were incomplete and decided to fast-track a new plan for cyber incident response. Meanwhile, observers are wondering whether the U.S. government has a plan to deal with cyberattacks in the case of a shutdown. The lists of essential computer security personnel drawn up 15 years ago are irrelevant today, computer specialists told NextGov. In 1995, the only agencies concerned about cybersecurity were entities such as the FBI and CIA. Today, before any potential government shutdown happens, a plan of essential IT personnel should be determined, the specialists add. Agencies should be figuring out which systems will need daily surveillance and strategic defense, as well as evaluating the job descriptions of the people operating in those systems, former federal executives told NextGov. Hord Tipton, a former Interior Department CIO, agrees. “If they haven’t done it, there’s going to be a mad scramble, and there’s going to be a hole in the system,” he told the site. All government departments are supposed to have contingency plans on deck that spell out essential systems and the employees associated with them, according to federal rules. Meanwhile, some experts say determining which IT workers are essential depends more on the length of the shutdown. Jeffrey Wheatman, a security and privacy analyst with the Gartner research group, tells NextGov that a shutdown lasting a couple of weeks “would require incident response personnel, network administrators and staff who monitor firewall logs for potential intrusions.” If a shutdown lasted a month or longer, more employees would need to report, he said, adding: “New threats could emerge during that time frame, which demands people with strategy-oriented job functions to devise new lines of defense.” Employees who are deemed “essential” are critical to national security. Cyber warfare or holes in cybersecurity can threaten a nation’s infrastructure. In particular, the electric grid, the nation’s military assets, financial sector and telecommunications networks can be vulnerable in the face of an attack, reports Federal Computer Week."
"Whether or not the vice president was correct in his analysis of the state of the presidency in the year 2000, there can be no question that since then George W. Bush has dramatically expanded the powers of the president—primarily though not exclusively in matters pertaining to the war on terror."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is daring Senate Democrats to vote against fast-track trade legislation they supported less than a month ago.¶ The GOP leader has scheduled a procedural vote on fast-track for Tuesday, and is signaling he’s through offering concessions.¶ The Kentucky Republican believes he’ll get the 11 Democratic votes he needs to move forward because pro-trade Senate Democrats have already gone out on a limb to support fast-track — despite the cries of organized labor and other groups on the left.¶ McConnell also reasons that the Senate Democrats, having already voted once for fast-track, won’t want to thrust the dagger into President Obama’s prized legislative goal.¶ “Democrats already voted for TPA. This is what everybody already voted for,” said one Senate Republican leadership aide, referring to trade promotion authority, another name for fast-track.¶ The Democrats who backed fast-track in a dramatic vote last month are being asked to do so again, but this time for a bill that does not include Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers hurt by increased trade.¶ The idea is that the TAA program will be added to a separate bill providing preferential access to the U.S. market for African countries. That legislation is supposed to move after the fast-track bill, and the hope is that House Democrats who rejected it the first time as a way to stop fast-track will support it if the fast-track bill is sailing into law.¶ Senate Democrats have balked at McConnell’s plan to consider the bills separately, and have demanded additional concessions.¶ So far, the protests have barely moved the GOP leader, who is offering them only one additional sweetener: a bipartisan measure sponsored by Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown (D) and Rob Portman (R) that would empower the Commerce Department to take retaliatory action against foreign countries that violate trade rules. ¶ The Brown-Portman bill, which would help U.S. steel producers win anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports to the United States, has been added to the TAA package.¶ That’s a win Democrats who want tougher enforcement measures, and a win for Portman — a close ally of McConnell — who faces a tough-reelection next year in Ohio, a state with a large manufacturing sector that is vulnerable to foreign competition.¶ But it falls short of Democratic demands.¶ They have pushed this week for other concessions, such as adding a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank to the TAA package and boosting the $450 million allocated for TAA.¶ If pro-trade Senate Democrats vote against fast-track on Tuesday, it might not completely bury the bill, but it would definitely pile on the dirt.¶ And some pro-trade Democratic aides conceded Friday their bosses will likely vote for both measures next week.¶ Fourteen Democrats supported fast-track in the May vote. With five GOP defections expected, McConnell needs at least 11 of them on the second vote.¶ “I think this is probably going to get many members of the 14. Conversations are continuing today and through the weekend,” said a senior Democratic aide."
"Unfortunately, these examples are the exception, not the rule. In fact, we’re woefully behind in developing rigorous, scalable, and useful assessment systems that span prekindergarten through high school. Developing such assessment systems is critical to the entire SEL endeavor. If we want to make a measurable difference, we need to develop SEL assessment systems that are usable, feasible, and psychometrically sound. What is the current state of assessment? At this early stage, social and emotional assessments can only be used for limited purposes. Many teacher rating scales, and some direct assessments in some grades, can guide instruction, because they help teachers understand students’ strengths and needs (this is called formative assessment). Other assessments may be useful for monitoring progress, for guiding the development of special education interventions, or for evaluating programs and tracking students’ social and emotional development over time. Even for these specific purposes, however, the range of options is limited. Furthermore, fewer SEL assessments possess the rigorous psychometric properties we demand of assessments used for high-stakes accountability. One important question regards the extent to which SEL assessment should be used to measure teacher or school accountability. That said, important work is under way in California, as part of the CORE district experiment, to explore the use of students’ social and emotional self-reports as one part of a multifaceted district accountability plan. The CORE experiment will provide real-life lessons about the promises and pitfalls of SEL assessment for accountability purposes."
"But what is undeniable is that the 654 miles of walls and fences already on the US-Mexico border have made a mess out of the environment there. They’ve cut off, isolated, and reduced populations of some of the rarest and most amazing animals in North America, like the jaguar and ocelot (also known as the dwarf jaguar). They’ve led to the creation of miles of roads through pristine wilderness areas. They’ve even exacerbated flooding, becoming dams when rivers have overflowed. Now, DHS is eyeing unfenced areas in two Texas wildlife refuges that conservationists consider some of the most ecologically valuable areas on the border — home to armadillos and bobcats. If a wall were to slice through these ecosystems, it could cause irreversible damage to plants and animals already under serious threat. “We’ve been dealing with all these negative environmental impacts of fences on the border for more than a decade,” says Dan Millis of the Sierra Club Borderlands project. “And Trump’s proposal would make it worse.” The border region is ecologically rich because a lot of it has been federally protected The political boundary between the US and Mexico stretches 2,000 miles from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Along the way, there are three mountain chains, the two largest deserts in North America, vast cattle ranches, a handful of cities and their sprawling suburbs, and the Southern section of the mighty Rio Grande river. Much of the region has never been heavily populated, and over the years, several large swaths of land have been designated as protected areas. Today there are 25 million acres of protected US public lands within 100 miles of the line. That includes six wildlife refuges, six national parks, tribal lands, wilderness areas, and conservation areas — all of them managed by various federal agencies and tribal governments. On the Mexican side, meanwhile, sit protected areas like El Pinacate y Gran Desierto Altar, which abuts the US Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and parts of the Organ Pipe National Monument and Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona. Map of four widlife refuges and protected areas in Arizona and New Mexico that would be impacted by a border wall These protected areas have been established, in part, to protect wildlife and plants that span both countries. In the case of the El Pinacate and Cabeza Prieta, desert species like the Sonoran pronghorn (an antelope relative) have been able to migrate back and forth. But in recent years, that’s gotten harder with the construction of long sections of vehicle barriers and fences, as you can see from the map."
"But in the long term, agriculture presents perhaps the most significant illustration of how a warming world might erode America’s position. Right now the U.S. agricultural industry serves as a significant, if low-key, instrument of leverage in America’s own foreign affairs. The U.S. provides roughly a third of soy traded globally, nearly 40% of corn and 13% of wheat. By recent count, American staple crops are shipped to 174 countries, and democratic influence and power comes with them, all by design. And yet climate data analyzed for this project suggest that the U.S. farming industry is in danger. Crop yields from Texas north to Nebraska could fall by up to 90% by as soon as 2040 as the ideal growing region slips toward the Dakotas and the Canadian border. And unlike in Russia or Canada, that border hinders the U.S.’s ability to shift north along with the optimal conditions."
"This kind of research is more evidence to support the idea that evolution thrives on culling. The planet did really well from the Big Five mass-extinction events. The victims’ demise enabled new environments to develop and more diversification took place in other groups of animals and plants. Nature was the richer for it. In just this same way the planet can take advantage from the abuse we are giving it. The harder the abuse, the greater the change to the environment. But it also follows that it brings forward the extinctions of a whole selection of vulnerable organisms. If humans were to fall into this vulnerable category, we too would become extinct. The effect of this would be that the abuse would stop being inflicted and peace and quiet would return. It would take several thousands of years for this to happen, and even longer for many different new ecosystems to reach a steady state of climax. Meanwhile, of course, evolution would set to work and increase the diversity of the newly selected forms, without the threat of humans and all the other species that our extinction event killed off."
"With the fourth anniversary of the executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia fast approaching, we must continue to challenge the notion of “an eye for an eye”. Here are five reasons why. 1. You can’t take it back The death penalty is irreversible. Absolute judgments may lead to people paying for crimes they did not commit. Texas man Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly setting a fire that killed his three daughters. Following his execution, further evidence revealed that Willingham did not set the fire that caused their deaths. But it came too late. A mug shot of Cameron Todd Willingham. There are two photo side-by-side. One shows Willingham looking towards the camera, the other shows Willingham's side profile. Cameron Todd Willingham © Peter K. Levy / Flickr 2. It doesn’t deter criminals There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term. In, evidence reveals the opposite. Since abolishing the death penalty in 1976, Canada’s murder rate has steadily declined and as of 2016 was at its lowest since 1966. 3. There’s no ‘humane’ way to kill fact The 2006 execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, by a so-called ‘humane’ lethal injection, took 34 minutes and required two doses. Doctors have said that it is likely Diaz’ death was painful. Other brutal methods of execution used around the world include hanging, shooting and beheading. The nature of these deaths only continues to perpetuate the cycle of violence and may not alleviate the pain already suffered by the victims’ family. 4. It makes a public spectacle of an individual’s death Executions are often undertaken in an extremely public manner, with public hangings in Iran or live broadcasts of lethal injections in the US. According to UN human rights experts, executions in public serve no legitimate purpose and only increase the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of this punishment. “All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. “All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated.” HASSIBA HADJ SAHRAOUI 5. The death penalty is disappearing In 2017 two countries – Guinea and Mongolia – abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Today, 106 countries (the majority of the world’s states) have turned their backs on the death penalty for good. Those that continue to execute are a tiny minority standing against a wave of opposition. There are countless arguments for and against the death penalty."
"Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) data collection practices have eroded the public's trust in major technology companies -- and in the Internet, a Harris Interactive survey found. Harris polled over 2,000 U.S. adults for their opinions on surveillance, data gathering, Internet privacy and trust in a post-Snowden era. About 85% of those polled were at least somewhat familiar with Snowden's leaks about government surveillance and some 80% wanted Congress to implement new laws for curbing the NSA. Despite that, over half believed that mass surveillance helps prevent terrorism and an almost equal number felt that Internet companies should cooperate with the government's efforts in this regard. Somewhat paradoxically though, two out of three survey respondents also felt betrayed because ISPs and other online companies are working secretly with the government to collect and monitor the communications of private citizens. About 60% are less trusting of ISPs and other technology companies than before the revelations. The results reflect mixed emotions among Internet users said Stephen Cobb, a senior security researcher at security vendor Eset, which commissioned the Harris Interactive survey. ""People clearly are thinking more about the relationship between privacy and security. What the Snowden revelations have done is to surface the unresolved tension over this issue,"" he said. ""People would like, on the one hand, to think the surveillance is necessary. But there is push back against unnecessary surveillance."" There is little doubt that Snowden's revelations about major Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo secretly handing over customer data to intelligence agencies have shaken consumer confidence. ""The feeling of betrayal is considerable and understandable,"" Cobb said. One result is that people appear to be scaling back their Internet use. Nearly half of the respondents have become more cautious about what they say, where they go and what they do on the Internet. About 25% are less inclined to use email these days because of the same reason. Though the survey sample is relatively modest, the results are significant, Cobb said. Businesses would do well to pay attention to the results, he said. ""I don't know if banks or online retailers are noticing the same thing,"" he said."
"The scene sent a signal that he would take a hard stance on the protests, with only five months to go before the presidential election. Supporters and political experts say Mr Trump has returned to his 2016 campaign strategy of being aggressive on crime, while the focus on the protests has provided respite from the criticism of his handling of coronavirus. Earlier on Monday he told governors that they were “weak” and must “dominate” the streets. The rhetoric came days after he tweeted language previously used by segregationists — “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — and threatened to unleash “vicious dogs” on protesters the morning after taking refuge in an underground bunker. “He’s trying to increasingly push the pandemic to the lower half of the newspaper front page,” said David Gergen, a Harvard professor and former adviser to four presidents, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. [The president] was hired to get things done and not be the consoler-in-chief or hand-holder-in-chief Jason Miller, former communications strategist for Donald Trump While Mr Trump called himself an “ally of all peaceful protesters” on Monday, his history undermines that claim. In 1990, he told Playboy magazine that he applauded how China’s Communist party had cracked down on the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, saying it showed “the power of strength” while the US was seen as weak. On Monday, he told the governors that Minnesota, where Floyd died, was the “laughing stock of the world” due to the protests. Jason Miller, a former top communications strategist for Mr Trump, said there were some parallels with the 2016 race. He said it was important to remember that the president “was hired to get things done and not be the consoler-in-chief or hand-holder-in-chief”, and that Republicans wanted him to take a tough stance on crime."
"Calabresi and Yoo emphasize repeatedly their strong belief that the President has, and must have, an unqualified power to remove an executive branch subordinate.20 I agree that the President must have the power to remove any executive branch officer and that Congress cannot be allowed to give itself any role in the removal process. I am pleased that the Supreme Court has acted in a manner consistent with that view. I disagree with Calabresi and Yoo, however, to the extent that they argue that Congress cannot impose a for cause limit on the President’s power to remove some executive branch officers and to the extent that they argue that the President can remove without cause executive branch employees who have no policy making responsibility. I believe that the President can control policy making within the executive branch even though he does not have plenary power to remove every executive branch subordinate."
"The UAE has been withdrawing some forces from the war on Yemen. That has not put an end to their interference in Yemen by any stretch of the imagination, but it represents another setback for the Saudi coalition.

"If bleaching is the only factor stressing a coral reef it has a 70 per cent chance of recovery. The odds drop when you add in human stressors that in the Caribbean include mass tourism, hotel development, too much scuba diving in popular areas, the introduction of invasive marine species, overfishing, removal of coastal mangroves, coastal deforestation, chemical fertilizer runoff and animal waste from farming activities. Fortunately these are largely absent from Cuba’s southern coast. Combine this with sound public policy that created national marine parks here in 1996, and the Jardines de la Reina flourishes today. Overall health of the Jardines ecosystem allows it to thrive and recover quickly when stressed. The Jardines has survived Soviet-era chemical fertilizers, and the Long-spined urchin is making a comeback following a die-off in the 1980s. Today, Cuban agriculture is organic, and sound public policy based on scientific research works hand in hand with strict conservation laws that protect the Jardines de la Reina. And now the fortunate 500 divers each year get to experience a little time travel and see a Caribbean of 60 years ago."
"As immigration talks resume, the public debate has once again zeroed in on the merits of granting some type of so-called amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants. But another, more complicated dispute – where the sides are equally entrenched – is brewing behind the scenes between organized labor and business interests. That debate, over how to manage future flows of legal immigration, particularly the size and scope of some kind of temporary worker program, could just as easily derail any type of immigration overhaul. Farmers from California to North Carolina say they need more temporary workers to grow and pick crops. Increased border enforcement has made it harder to fill crucial agriculture jobs. Plant managers in North Carolina and South Carolina, for example, have been forced to turn to prisons to man assembly lines at poultry plants. Farmers need more hands in the orchards picking nuts and fruits in California’s Central Valley and grapes at vineyards in Washington state’s Tri-Cities area. “The workers are not here,” said Manuel Cunha, president of the Fresno, Calif.-based Nisei Farmers League. “You got to have milkers. You don’t bring anyone out of the unemployment line to milk cows.” But labor unions are wary of expanding guest-worker programs, insisting on a path to citizenship and worrying about what they say are abuses of the guest-worker programs and unfair competition to American laborers. In North Carolina, growers have been able to harvest their crops thanks to about 7,500 foreign workers employed by farmers through the federal H-2A temporary visa program. The program brings foreign agriculture workers in for months at a time, pays wages for their labor and sends the workers home until the next season. In all, about 70,000 workers were hired through the H-2A program last year. The program is widely criticized by farmers as cumbersome and expensive. Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, advocates for revamping the program to make it more cost effective and easier to use. He said Americans simply do not want to do the back-breaking work picking fruits and vegetables. “We had 270 U.S. applicants apply for 7,500 openings,” Wicker said of this year. Talks on developing comprehensive immigration legislation resumed this month after Latino voters overwhelmingly supported President Barack Obama for another term. Republican leaders, mindful of the electorate’s demographic changes, now say they’re willing to discuss some type of path to legalization for some of the estimated 11 million people who are living in the United States illegally. But in return, they say, border security must be improved and Democrats have to stand up to unions and support an expanded guest-worker program, including some non-agriculture jobs, in order to prevent future waves of mass illegal immigration. Some fear that a path to legal status without an accompanying worker program would lure more undocumented immigrants into the United States. “There is so much agreement on border security, employment verification,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told McClatchy. “It breaks down on the number of guest workers. Unions hate that, but we have to have it. And the 12 million is a problem for the Republicans. We have to find some common ground.” A similar dispute, Republicans say, helped derail the Senate’s 2007 comprehensive immigration bill. Then, an amendment was introduced that would have phased out a new program to increase the number of temporary workers. Republicans saw the temporary worker program as a critical compromise to limit future waves of illegal immigration."
"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a two-day visit, Abadi’s first since assuming office in September 2014. During Abadi’s visit, China and Iraq issued a joint statement upgrading their relationship to a strategic partnership. In a meeting with Abadi, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the development of China-Iraq ties, and said that the new strategic partnership would provide “a solid foundation” for future advances in the relationship. Xi also pledged Chinese assistance in “energy, electricity, communication and infrastructure” projects in Iraq, which he tied to China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. In his own meeting with Abadi, Premier Li Keqiang repeated that promise, and also mentioned building up Iraq’s production capacity in certain manufacturing industries. But energy in particular remains in the bedrock of China-Iraq relations, as China’s oil imports have skyrocketed over the past decade. China imported just 1 million tonnes of oil from Iraq during the whole year of 2006. By contrast, in January of 2015 alone, China received 3.4 million tonnes of oil from Iraq, making the country Beijing’s second-largest oil supplier (behind only Saudi Arabia). Chinese oil firms expected to import about three tonnes of oil per month from Iraq in 2015. Overall, China imports nearly half of Iraq’s total oil production. On Tuesday, China and Iraq signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on oil and gas, pledging a “long-term and comprehensive strategic partnership on energy cooperation.” The two countries vowed to expand their already-considerable cooperation in the energy field, with more investment going to boost the oil trade as well as exploration and development of oil and gas fields and the construction of infrastructure for storing and transporting energy resources. However, expanding energy cooperation is easier said than done. China’s existing oil investments in Iraq face threats from security concerns, notably the Islamic State. While Chinese-invested oilfields (which are largely clustered in southern Iraq) have mostly been spared from the IS threat, the crisis within Iraq has seriously limited the country’s ability to extract and export oil as planned. In 2014, China and Iraq were supposed to double their oil trade due to new contracts and investment from Chinese firms; only half of that increase was actually realized. Despite the impact on its energy imports, China has stayed out of the fight against IS, despite nudges from Iraqi government officials for more aid from Beijing. China voices support for Iraq’s government, but is only willing to provide modest support in the form of limited personnel training and humanitarian aid. Similarly, the joint statement signed between Iraq and China this week saw Beijing pledge to “support Iraq’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence” without making any specific commitments. Meanwhile, both Beijing and Baghdad promised to “to support each other’s efforts to maintain national security, stability and to fight against terrorism.” Abadi’s visit to China comes as he pushes back against the idea of deploying U.S. ground troops in Iraq. Abadi told NPR in a recent interview that “we don’t want boots on the ground. Full stop.” Instead, he said, the United States and its coalition should increase their commitment to air strikes against IS, calling the current level of support “limited.” “We can destroy Daesh… But we need proper intelligence and proper air cover and support,” Abadi said. That’s not something China can (or is willing to) provide, despite Beijing’s own serious concerns about terrorism. Instead, Beijing is continuing to offer the same prescription for Iraq: economic cooperation, focused on the energy sector."
"China has created a large and modern navy, which, at the present rate will, by 2020, be substantially larger than America’s. Its vessels are highly capable and armed with long-range, advanced, anti-ship missiles and air-defense missiles. China is upgrading its nuclear arsenal and is on track to more than double the number of nuclear warheads capable of striking the U.S. homeland over the next few years. They already have the world’s largest and most lethal inventory of conventional ballistic missiles as well as large numbers of highly capable and long-range ground, air and sea-based cruise missiles. They will continue to expand, diversify, and improve their missile inventory, enhancing their ability to coerce or use force against the United States and its allies and partners in Asia. China now is able to threaten U.S. bases and operating areas throughout the region, including those that it previously could not reach with conventional weapons, such as Anderson Air Force Base on Guam. They have almost 2,000 capable fighter aircraft and are on track to introduce two new fifth-generation fighters, which they will likely add to their inventory between 2017 and 2019. China also appears to be developing a new long-range stealth bomber. China is significantly upgrading its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and improving amphibious capabilities. According to the Defense Science Board, China already has offensive cyber capabilities that can inflict existential damage – damage comparable to that caused by a nuclear exchange – on America’s critical infrastructure and upon our society. The best way to think of the Chinese buildup is this: they are constructing a missile-centric military to take advantage of an asymmetric vulnerability of the United States. That’s the result of a lesson they learned almost 20 years ago. In fact, China is already triggering confrontations; the shift in the balance of power – the growing ability of China to exploit America’s asymmetric vulnerability – is already affecting China’s calculations in the East and South China Seas. China claims sovereignty over virtually the entirety of those seas and the island formations in them. In the South China Sea, for example, their claims, illustrated by their infamous “nine-dash” line, encompasses Taiwan, and extend virtually to the shores of the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei, and also include waters legitimately claimed by Indonesia. This is not some small matter. The South China Sea is twice the size of Alaska. Some of the most important shipping lanes pass through these waters. Petroleum reserves beneath these waters may equal half of Saudi Arabia’s proven reserves. To enforce these claims, China unilaterally exercises the rights of a sovereign, presenting its neighbors with the choice of either acceding de facto to its claims or starting a shooting war with a regionally dominant military power that has a large, modern navy and a tremendous missile arsenal looming in the background. The first is economic and strategic. China wants unfettered access to the resources in its near seas and control over its strategic environment. Another is nationalistic and historical. China has historically been the “middle kingdom” in Asia. That’s how they view themselves. And what does that mean? It means that Chinese leaders believe that the countries along their periphery should be in various stages of vassalage to China. It’s important to understand the broader implications of this view. A Japanese scholar once said to me that “whereas we [the democratic countries] view the world horizontally, China views the world vertically – with China at the top of the food chain. In such a world, there is no equality; there is no rule of law. Since World War II, the United States and its allies have created an international system that fosters, however imperfectly, a) free and equal access to the seas, air, space, and cyberspace, b) neutral rules governing trade, and c) the resolution of disputes according to accepted norms, where smaller countries are at no disadvantage. It’s sometimes referred to as a “norm-based international system.” China’s leaders have accepted the benefits of such a system to facilitate their ascent, but resist complying with the restrictions; they see the world as one where “the big dogs get the benefits” within their respective spheres of influence, and they view Asia, or East Asia at least, as their sphere."
"Second, key strands of the LIO concept suffer serious theoretical weaknesses. For example, one strand argues that a powerful state can bind itself to institutions, thereby reassuring weaker partners that it will meet its alliance commitments, neither abandoning its allies nor using force coercively against them; such reassurance was essential to NATO's success during the Cold War. A powerful state, however, cannot effectively constrain its ability to use its power/military force when the stakes are sufficiently high. Another strand of the LIO concept holds that hierarchy built on legitimate authority, granted by subordinate (i.e., weaker) states to the dominant (i.e., stronger) state, is essential to explaining cooperation under anarchy. According to this argument, hierarchy plays a central role in explaining cooperation among NATO's member states. I show, however, that this has not been the case and that established theories of alliance cooperation explain cooperation within NATO quite well. Given these theoretical weaknesses, the LIO concept cannot support claims that the LIO's institutions have been more effective or better able to weather shocks from the international system than they would have been otherwise."
"If the most telling scorecard of a U.S. presidency is the economy, then President Joe Biden deserves high marks for his first 100 days. It’s a small sample, of course – featuring data for just a couple of months – but measures of job growth and retail sales pointed to a booming economy in March. And analysts say that’s likely just the beginning of a historically robust year. Much of the surge can be traced to growing COVID-19 vaccinations – with 40% of the population having received at least one shot, according to Goldman Sachs – a leveling off of virus cases, and the lifting of business restrictions in many states. And don’t forget the nearly $4 trillion in Congress’s COVID-19 relief packages, including $1,800 per person in stimulus checks sent to most Americans through December. In other words, the economy was on track to bust out even before Biden moved into the White House. “Just the economy reopening would go a long way toward healing the wounds,” says Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial. Yet under Biden, the vaccine rollout has been faster than expected at more than 3 million shots a day the past couple of weeks. “Biden gets props for getting the vaccine process sped up,” Moody says. He also spearheaded the latest $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, passed by Congress in March, that includes another round of $1,400 stimulus checks. The Treasury Department says it has disbursed 161 million of those payments totaling $379 billion. All told, Americans are flush with an additional $2.4 trillion that they’ve squirreled way during the outbreak and they’re ready to spend much of it just as the economy is getting back on its feet. Put simply, the president helped put a strong recovery on steroids. “We can give Biden credit for improving consumer and business confidence,” says Bernard Baumohl, chief economist of the Economic Outlook Group. There are still risks, including the possibility of COVID-19 spikes that outpace vaccinations. Another hindrance could be the supply-chain delays, including chip shortages, that have hobbled manufacturers and undermined sales of cars, smartphones and other products."
"It's more than a little upsetting that in more than three hours of testimony before Congress on her nomination to be the new U.S. secretary of education, neither Betsy DeVos nor the members of Congress grilling her said anything—not a single word—about a cohort of more than a half-million American students who will fall under the Department of Education's remit. That group? Native American students. The challenges facing Native students in America today are known, although hardly ever discussed outside of Native communities. According to national statistics, our students are more likely to be labeled as having special needs and experience higher rates of suspension and expulsion than white students. Just 67 percent of Native students graduate from high school—a figure well below the national average. —Getty This is in part due to a tribal education system that has been imposed on us by the federal government for 150 years. But contrary to what many think, education in Indian Country is not in need of a solution imposed by others who know little about our communities. Solutions already lie within. Created in the 19th century, the federal system responsible for educating American Indian students and funding Indian schools is a direct result of treaties entered into by our sovereign tribal nations and the federal government. At its inception, this education system had a stated policy of forcing the assimilation of Indian people by eradicating tribal culture. Students were intentionally taken away from their families and placed in boarding schools, where many endured physical and mental abuse. Slowly, the federal government moved away from these devastating policies, but the system that remains today for Native students is underfunded and inadequately staffed. The buildings our students study in are plagued with infrastructure problems, yet federal money, which should be guaranteed in accordance with long-standing treaties, has not been made available to fix them. The story of the Havasupai Elementary School in Arizona, at the heart of a recently filed lawsuit, is an example of how our federal education system has failed Native students. Nine students from the school are suing the Bureau of Indian Education for ""knowingly failing to provide basic general education."" These are problems seen not just in this school, but in many other BIE schools across Indian Country. The failure to fully fund school construction, renovations, and repairs, coupled with the current federal hiring freeze (which could prevent teacher vacancies from being filled), does not set our students up for success. ""The system that remains today for Native students is underfunded and inadequately staffed."" Still, many outside of Indian Country have offered several ""answers"" to repair the failing, broken system our children and their families endure. There have been calls to privatize schools through vouchers, to move responsibility from the federal government to state control, or to close some BIE schools entirely. Every one of these so-called solutions, while well-meaning, has a common thread: Tribes and Native people were not involved in the development of any of them. This means, unfortunately for us all, they are unlikely to work. Simply put, lasting solutions must be developed in partnership with Native communities, and there are examples across Indian Country that show how tribal innovation and leadership can lead to programs and services that meet communitywide needs. Through local control and direct community engagement, tribes have redesigned their courts, health-care systems, and workforce. For example, in Alaska, innovative approaches to dental health have made significant headway in improving youths' oral health at a fraction of the standard cost. In Montana, the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai have transformed workforce-development programs and cut their unemployment rate by 20 percentage points. In Washington state, the Tulalip Tribe has developed a world-class, culturally sensitive tribal court system that has reduced recidivism rates among tribal offenders. Programs like these show that a win-win situation is possible when federal funds are spent in accordance with what the community wants and needs. And, today, we have a new opportunity to ensure these same successes in education. The education system promised by the trust responsibility to our tribes must be honored, not dismantled with vouchers or a hand-off of control to a state or local government body. The solutions lie within our communities. Everyone—tribes, the federal government, and other partners—must work together to ensure that the schools where our children are educated have the flexibility to create innovative approaches to meet the unique educational and cultural needs of Indian students. This can only be done through a tribal-led system. The work needed to transform the lasting hallmarks of a failed federal system cannot be done overnight or in isolation. Before more money is thrown into another well-meaning but poorly crafted solution, our existing schools should be given every opportunity to thrive, regardless of who leads the Department of Education. Native students absolutely need new culturally based approaches to providing the world-class education they deserve. To get there, we need committed partners who understand that traditional knowledge and culture-based education are key to producing engaged, successful learners. And we need partners who understand that tribes and Native communities must not only have a voice, they must lead the way."
"The Human Security Report 2005 challenged the commonly held assumption that armed conflict around the world had become more widespread and more violent. It showed that the number of state-based armed conflicts—those in which a government is one of the warring parties—had declined sharply since the end of the Cold War, and that they had become dramatically less deadly since the end of World War II."
"Examining biodiversity and abundance data from 625 surveys, the researchers found no discernible differences between partially protected MPAs and coastal areas with zero protections—no more fish, algae, or invertebrates. By contrast, and in line with previous research, fully protected areas boasted more species and bigger fish than unprotected areas."
"Bataille’s analysis of domination is rooted in his study of the body, and the terror and shame human animals can feel before it. e body is unpredictable: It leaks, expels, hungers, fails, and ultimately dies. Our bodies are our opening to life, but also to death. And this inevitable death seems to suggest insignificance before the putrefaction from which we come and will one day return. Humans, Bataille writes in his masterwork the Accursed Share, “[appear] to be the only animal to be ashamed of that nature whence he comes, and from which he does not cease to have departed.”24 We feel primal shame, according to Bataille, because the decay we are conscious of suggests servility and baseness.25 is primary disdain for animal nature, and our dependence upon it, spurs fantastical efforts to dominate our bodies, each other, and the more-than-human-world in attempts to o set felt servility with felt dominance. For Bataille, much of human history can be read as a permanent struggle against animality.26 In e Accursed Share he observes that humanity “resembles those parvenus who are ashamed of their humble origin. Thy rid themselves of anything suggesting it. What are the ‘noble’ and ‘good’ families,” he writes of upper class morality, “if not those in which their wealthy birth is the most carefully concealed?”27 One of the crucial rationales for accumulating wealth, according to Bataille, is that material riches help us distinguish ourselves not only from animality, but also from those we take to be nature’s proxies in our fantastical e orts to dominate the nature we fear. Proxies, in the Euro-American context, have included Indigenous peoples, women, people of color, and workers. ese proxies have been discursively linked to animal nature and then materially controlled in efforts to provide compensatory hits of dominion. For Bataille, “[i]t is not so much wealth... that distinguishes, that qualities socially, as it is the greatest distance from animality.”28 We dominate our bodies and each other in efforts to surpass and ultimately control our animality, our impermanence. is desire to “destroy the animal nature within us,” he suggests, lurks behind many of our most vexing political and ecological problems.29 In Bataille’s view, the pull of existential resentment is universal; it is a human struggle.30 He is attuned, however, to the important mediating role played by culture. Individuals and cultures relate to existential realities like impermanence in multiple ways. Tibetan Buddhism, for example, offers meditative practices for befriending the reality of death. We are not destined to resentfully interpret death as domineering, or to flee from felt servility with fantasies of mastery."
"Unfortunately, this is due to the fact that most people do not recognize that the Caribbean is a gateway for two of the highest-priority security issues in the United States: drug trafficking and energy dependence. While the doomsday scenario of nuclear war in the Middle East is highly provocative, security in the Caribbean may have a greater effect on the everyday lives of Americans. The Keystone Pipeline Project received so much attention, not solely because of the potential for job creation with the project, but because of its potential to provide another reliable source of foreign energy. Any security threat in the Caribbean could pose a grave threat to currently reliable sources of foreign energy. Both Venezuela and Colombia were among the 10 largest suppliers of oil imports to the US in 2010. Even the island-nation of Trinidad and Tobago provided more oil to the United States in 2010 than did Libya. Trinidad & Tobago also provides more natural gas to the US than any other nation except Canada. Perhaps an even more jarring statistic to drive home this point is that about 64 percent of all energy imports pass through the Caribbean Sea before they reach American refineries on the Gulf Coast. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, it is quite possible that the security of the Caribbean region could become even more important in the years to come."
"As mentioned above, there is another order of criticism or discrepancy toward the term Islamophobia, which though fully linked to ethnic, religious and cultural aspects, is in itself used as individual criticism over the use of this terminology. Such is firstly the case of ‘etymological/ terminological criticism.’ From this viewpoint, the terms ‘anti-Muslim racism,’ ‘anti- Arab’ or even ‘intolerance against Muslims’ 18 are clearer than the term Islamophobia for various reasons. On the one hand, use of the word ‘phobia’ in the concept is not considered appropriate, as it would imply the existence of a sort of mental illness (phobia: obsessive aversion to someone or something and/or compulsive irrational fear); on the other, the term Islamophobia is not considered ‘ideal,’ for there is no specific rejection of Islam as a religion, but rather a rejection of Muslim individuals or collectives or those defined as such. This kind of criticism even makes an analogy between the word Islamophobia and the word ‘anti-Semitism,’ arguing that from a grammatical standpoint anti-Semitism should signify a prejudice against Semitic peoples in general, even though it is exclusively used to refer to hostility against the Jews. In this regard, the grammatically incorrect Islamophobia would require the 150 years which the term ‘anti-Semitism’ needed to become grammatically acceptable, except that Jews recognize themselves and are recognized as being a single ethnic group, contrary to the case of Muslims."
"Is U.S. influence in Latin America on the wane? It depends how you look at it.¶ As President Obama travels to Mexico and Costa Rica, it’s likely the pundits will once again underscore what some perceive to be the eroding influence of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. Some will point to the decline in foreign aid or the absence of an overarching policy with an inspiring moniker like “Alliance for Progress” or “Enterprise Area of the Americas” as evidence that the United States is failing to embrace the opportunities of a region that is more important to this country than ever.¶ The reality is a lot more complicated. Forty-two percent of all U.S. exports flow to the Western Hemisphere. In many ways, U.S. engagement in the Americas is more pervasive than ever, even if more diffused. That is in part because the peoples of the Western Hemisphere are not waiting for governments to choreograph their interactions.¶ A more-nuanced assessment inevitably will highlight the complex, multidimensional ties between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere. In fact, it may be that we need to change the way we think and talk about the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. We also need to resist the temptation to embrace overly reductive yardsticks for judging our standing in the hemisphere.¶ As Moises Naim notes in his recent book, The End of Power, there has been an important change in power distribution in the world away from states toward an expanding and increasingly mobile set of actors that are dramatically shaping the nature and scope of global relationships. In Latin America, many of the most substantive and dynamic forms of engagement are occurring in a web of cross-national relationships involving small and large companies, people-to-people contact through student exchanges and social media, travel and migration.¶ Trade and investment remain the most enduring and measurable dimensions of U.S."
"Given this range of interests, Keohane and Victor write, ""institutions such as the UNFCCC that require near-universal consensus are likely to make only modest progress. Even states that would conditionally be willing to do more are unlikely to offer ambitious policies, insofar as such policies would make sense for them only in the context of an ambitious agreement in which all major polluters participated."""
"TO JUDGE by the doom-laden prophecies cascading in from Washington, the United States faces a towering and imminent threat in the form of the militant group calling itself the Islamic State, or ISIS. “They are coming here,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina intoned on Fox News Sunday. “I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists’ ability to operate in Syria and Iraq.” Senator Graham’s friend Senator John McCain is no less alarmist. Calling for immediate air strikes in Iraq and Syria, he declared, “They are getting stronger all the time . . . And their goal . . . is destruction of the United States of America.” Stoking the panic has been a very excitable press. On CNN last week, I was asked if Islamic State fighters represented an “existential threat” to the United States. Set aside that absurdity; no terrorist group threatens our existence. (America has faced one existential threat in modern times — the Soviet nuclear arsenal — and that is it.) But is the Islamic State a huge and menacing terrorist threat? Certainly not to the United States today. The danger to Iraq and its neighbors is real. The Islamic State has shown itself to be a formidable insurgency. Its focus is on ripping apart Iraq and Syria, sowing sectarian conflict, and creating in its midst a new jihadist state or caliphate. (That very word seems to incite fearmongers: “Every day that goes by, ISIS builds up its caliphate, and it becomes a direct threat to the United States,” said New York Representative Peter King, conjuring an image of a new Golden Horde with nuclear-tipped scimitars.) If the insurgency grows, and the threat to Jordan or Lebanon increases, we may have to act. But, for now, it’s important to understand that even if marauding operatives in Land Cruisers may be humiliating Iraq’s hollowed-out military, that doesn’t mean they have genuine terrorist skills. Consider the details: The Islamic State has never carried out a significant attack outside of its neighborhood. In 2005, when its operatives were still part of Al Qaeda in Iraq, operatives carried out hotel bombings in Jordan and tried and failed to attack an American warship in the Red Sea. More recently, four people were killed in an apparent lone-wolf attack at the Jewish museum in Brussels by a young man trained in Syria. In other words, we’ve seen no demonstrated ability to carry out the kind of complex international strike that kills dozens or hundreds, let alone engulfs a US city in flames. That is not to say Islamic State militants couldn’t develop those capabilities. As I wrote on this page in June, a vast ungoverned area has opened up in Syria and Iraq, opening up more space for terrorism to thrive. Additionally, the Islamic State’s cause has attracted foreign fighters from Europe and, in small numbers, America. Those are the people to worry about, since they have useful passports and the ability to operate in the West. What’s more, the group appears to be attracting attention from other jihadist organizations. Possibly the greatest risk today continues to be from Yemen, home to the same bomb makers who armed a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, with a hard-to-detect explosive sewn into his underwear and put him on a 2009 flight bound for Detroit. If these technicians join forces with the Islamic State, the threat level will go up markedly. These risks, however, don’t argue for abandoning the administration’s current targeted strategy in Iraq and instead launching a wide-ranging air campaign. To begin with, bombing insurgent formations isn’t going to reduce terrorism. The cells to worry over aren’t headed toward Erbil or Baghdad. More importantly, to deal with a terrorist group like the Islamic State requires local partners, and those partners will have to be Iraqis. That’s why it is vital that a new government is formed in Baghdad with a renewed effort at inclusiveness among Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds. As the White House recognizes, if that effort fails, and the sectarianism persists, Iraq will disintegrate. And if the United States takes ownership of fighting the Islamic State, Iraq’s common security problem, there’d be little incentive for cooperation. Ultimately, a more fearsome civil war will occur, and the danger to the West will expand exponentially. Terrorists thrive in conflict zones. Yes, we probably have a confrontation with the Islamic State — a group with a desire to kill Americans in its DNA — in our future. It’s a good bet that within a year or two, there will be extensive American intelligence operations throughout Iraq, and US drones flying its skies. As we head toward that eventuality, however, we should remember the critical advances (despite Edward Snowden) in US intelligence gathering since 9/11. We can’t stop every solo operative who gets his hands on a rifle or even gunpowder and ball bearings — but that reality doesn’t threaten our existence. And hysteria and missteps in the field aren’t going to make us safer."
"The Judge also sent a strong message as to the hurdle the DOJ would have to overcome regarding air travel: “The right to travel here and abroad is an important constitutional right. To deny this right to a citizen . . . based on inaccurate information without an effective means of redress would unconstitutionally burden the right to travel. While the Constitution does not ordinarily agree the right to travel by any particular form of transportation, given that other forms of travel usually remain possible, the fact remains that for international travel, air transport in these modern times is practically the only form of transportation, travel by ship being prohibitively expensive or so it will be presumed at the pleading stage.” This isn’t exactly new, as so eloquently stated in Kent v. Dulles (1958): “The right to travel is a part of the ‘liberty’ of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. So much is conceded by the Solicitor General. In Anglo-Saxon law, that right was emerging at least as early as the Magna Carta. Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 (1956), 171-181, 187 et seq., shows how deeply engrained in our history this freedom of movement is. Freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country, may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values.”"
"The great frontier of space is increasingly cluttered with debris, and a Russian engineer warns that damage to a satellite from some hypothetical collision may be misconstrued as a deliberate act of sabotage.¶ With the global village increasingly dependent on satellites and other space-based equipment, Academician Yury Zaitsev of the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences believes that accidental damage to an American or Russian satellite by runaway space garbage may be seen as a deliberate attack from a foreign entity, which may be the spark to ignite a conflict.¶ ""The American, Russian and other defense agencies have already been suffering serious losses, caused by the collision of satellites with space garbage,” Zaitsev said. “Space garbage hitting and disabling a military satellite may be seen as an attack, which could provoke retaliation with all of the ensuing consequences.”¶ As more nations send their own satellites into outer space, the risk of space collisions has increased dramatically over the last decade.¶ US space engineers seem to agree with their Russian counterparts concerning the risk of potential space collisions involving debris. Last year, the US-based National Research Council reported that the amount of space debris “has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to collide continually and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures.”¶ However, the issues raised by Zaitsev over the possibility of a conflict arising as the result of some “accidental” space collision deserve consideration."
"Russia and China’s grand bargain on energy, a 30-year, $400 billion  deal to pipe natural gas from Russia’s   Far East to China, has prompted much commentary on the agreement’s potential to reshape global energy markets and tilt the balance of influence in Ukraine and, more broadly, in Europe. The deal has “upped the ante for Europeans to diversify their gas imports away from Russia,” said Erica Downs of the Brookings Institution; it means producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) “may face more competitive markets in Japan and South Korea, which together bought more than half of the world’s supply in 2013,” wrote Chou Hui Hong, a Singapore-based reporter for Bloomberg News; “the implications are potentially huge for Russia, for China and much of Asia, and also for Europe,” declared Keith Johnson, covering all the bases in Foreign Policy.¶ All the bases, that is, except one: the United States. The shale gas revolution in the States has led natural gas producers to envision an export boom in which U.S. companies become key suppliers to East Asia while countering Russian influence by shipping large amounts of LNG to Europe. President Obama said in 2012 that the U.S. is becoming “the Saudia Arabia of natural gas.”¶ Indeed, U.S. petroleum exports reached 3.5 million barrels a day in 2013, roughly double the level of 5 years ago, according to the Energy Information Administration. Proponents of increased LNG exports argue that the gas export boom will bring in billions in profits for American companies, create thousands of high-paying jobs, and reduce the influence of undesirable LNG suppliers, i.e., Vladimir Putin’s Russia.¶ All of that is, potentially, true. But there are signals that, even before the Russo-Chinese gas deal, natural gas advocates were overstating the potential market. And with China building pipelines to ship LNG across Central Asia, the market opportunity is dwindling fast."
"That lack of understanding among ordinary Americans concerns me deeply because it increases the public's suspicions and cynicism about the Congress, weakens the relationship between voters and their representatives, makes it harder for public officials to govern, and prevents our representative democracy from working the way it should. May I suggest that you have a unique responsibility and opportunity to help combat this misunderstanding of Congress because of your roles as teachers and leading analysts of the institution across the country. I believe you can improve public understanding of Congress by teaching several basic, and rather simple, lessons about this sometimes puzzling institution. My concern here is not with your understanding of the Congress. In my experience, political scientists understand the institution very well. And I know that many of you are excellent teachers who teach many of the things that I will recommend and much more. The point I want to make is that you, as much as anyone, have the power to influence the way Americans view our political system. That is not an influence you, or anyone else, should take lightly, because the way Americans look at politics shapes the capacity of our government to meet the needs of the country. If Americans leave high school and college with a solid understanding of Congress, they will be better able to contribute to our nation's political life and will help make our representative democracy work better."
"Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson’s (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland’s (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that ’future expectation of trade’ is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg & Hess, 2002. p. 89) Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, & Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. “Diversionary theory” suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a ’rally around the flag’ effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention."
"The pursuit of significantly more aggressive measures to counter North Korea’s rising nuclear capability would mark a significant shift in U.S. policy away from its current focus. Adoption of a regime change policy would require the United States to run the risks associated with such an approach, including the dangers inherent in the precipitate collapse of the North Korean regime."
"As the nation reframes its thinking about wildfire — from the routine natural burns of 50 years ago to today's climate-aggravated megablazes — it is crucial not to overlook the worst-case scenario: a major metropolis engulfed in fire. America has seen previews of this catastrophe: In 1991, a wildfire swept into the hills and canyons above Oakland, overwhelming firefighters, claiming 25 lives, injuring 150 other people and causing more than $1.5 billion in property damage. The 2003 Cedar Fire, driven by Southern California's fierce Santa Ana winds, scorched more than 280,000 acres. The worst fire in the state record books, the October blaze reached into the suburbs of San Diego, burning more than 2,200 homes. Wildfire hit again in 2007, forcing thousands of residents to take refuge in Qualcomm Stadium, the venue where the NFL's Chargers play. In a small blessing, the record fire season in the Pacific Northwest this summer has been relatively limited in its human and financial costs. The affected region is sparsely populated forest and rangeland, separated from Seattle and Portland by a major mountain range. But the fires' secondary effects on these cities shouldn't be discounted: In late August, shifting winds funneled dangerous smoke from multiple fires down through the Columbia Gorge, temporarily turning Portland into a smoke box. Particulate concentrations in the city's air reached ""unhealthy"" levels usually not seen outside Beijing. But in the big picture, America was lucky that wildfire hadn't struck the parched hills of Silicon Valley, or swept down through Colorado's Front Range into the suburbs west of Denver. Indeed, Northern California skirted disaster in July. The Rocky Fire — sparked by a decrepit water heater — threatened the city of Clear Lake, north of the state's fabled Napa Valley, ripping through 70,000 acres, jumping a highway and subjecting 13,000 residents to evacuation orders. Ken Pimlott, the director of CAL Fire, the state's fire authority, says California still faces ""unprecedented fire behavior and fuel conditions"" and that the worst of the fire season is likely ""yet to come"" in Southern California. ""We haven't dodged a bullet by any stretch of the imagination,"" he says. California Gov. Jerry Brown has recently been calling out the Republican presidential candidates who refuse to even acknowledge that climate change exists. ""Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts aren't on the horizon,"" he wrote in an open letter to GOP candidates. ""They're all here — and here to stay."" With a lightning strike or an arsonist's match, the fire next time could threaten San Jose, San Diego or the L.A. Basin — each a major engine of the national economy. At its most dangerous, warming-driven wildfire poses an existential threat. ""The climate is unstable,"" Brown told reporters in August. ""If the drought was to continue for a year or several years, California could literally burn up."""
"A base for 2024: Successful midterm elections can become a platform to prepare for a successful run against the president in his reelection bid. In 1966, for instance, Republicans gained seats in the midterm elections even though Democrats retained control of the House and Senate (which, other than when the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987, the Democrats held from 1955 to 1995). Teaming up with southern Democrats, in 1967 and 1968, Republicans put pressure on President Lyndon B. Johnson to cut Great Society spending and to deal with the inflationary effects of the war in Vietnam, all of which helped Richard Nixon win office in 1968."
"We humans need food for proper nutrition. In times of crisis, access to a stable food supply is the key to continued survival. In the presence of natural disasters, human conflicts, climate change, and overpopulation, the threat of food shortages and total famine is not as far-fetched as it seems. Preparing long-term food supplies can buffer the effects of these potential catastrophes. The Anatomy of a Catastrophe Many people think that food shortages may be a thing of the past. Thanks to the marvels of modern technology and scientific farming methods, we have a constant and abundant supply of food. It is difficult to imagine how a food shortage can happen – but it is still a possibility. During ancient times, humans hunted and gathered for food. Then a revolution occurred and changed the course of history: we learned how to cultivate the soil, plant crops, and domesticate animals for a stable source of food. Eventually, modern technology has improved farming and fishing techniques, that food production has now become large-scale. People now depend on hard-working farmers and fishermen for their everyday supply of food. But what happens when the harvests are poor? The farmer will keep his produce to feed his own family first – other people are left without food. Such scenario is still possible today because there are man-made disasters and natural calamities that threaten the world’s food supply. For example, a hurricane rages across the country and floods several states. Our access to food is restricted because travel is nearly impossible. To add to that, business establishments like groceries and supermarkets are probably closed down due to the flood as well as a power outage. Some might argue that this is not a real food shortage scenario because the problem is merely logistics: there is food; it is just that we have no access to it. It is true that natural calamities and wars cause a food shortage only temporarily. However, recent studies show that at present, we consume more than we produce. The UN warns that grain reserves are progressively getting lower because of droughts and crop failures in major food producing countries. The famine in Africa may possibly be felt in other parts of the world. This is an emergency situation that requires us to prepare beforehand. We must have a supply of food and water for us to survive."
"Two key Senate Republicans on executive branch oversight are expressing worry that federal agencies -- including possibly OSHA and other branches of the Labor Department -- have repeatedly leveraged guidance documents to create effectively binding policies without going through rulemaking channels. They are asking Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and some other department heads for data on any complaints lodged with agencies that guidance documents are being used to enforce policies on which the public had no input. One industry attorney says OSHA is clearly involved, as the agency uses guidance on issues such as ergonomics, heat illness and crowd control as ""cannon fodder"" for general-duty cases against industry -- though it will be hard for Republicans to prove OSHA used such guidance alone to bolster citations. Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN) and Sen. James Lankford (OK) note that a recent Supreme Court decision affecting administrative law, Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, clarified that guidance is meant to ""advise the public"" and ""do[es] not have the force and effect of law."" That decision held that substantial changes to interpretive rules (as opposed to legislative rules) are not required to go through notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). ""We are concerned, however, that federal agencies are increasingly using guidance that appears to create new requirements without the benefit of notice and comment but with the expectation that the public comply,"" the senators told Perez May 7. They cited recent testimony before the health committee, which Alexander chairs, by an Education Department official saying the agency expected that colleges and universities comply with its guidance. ""Yet, guidance is not intended to be binding."" Lankford chairs the subcommittee on regulatory affairs and federal management. The GOP letter does not name OSHA but makes clear that all of the DOL agencies are subject to the lawmakers' information requests -- including a list of all guidance issued on or after July 24, 2007 that have been the subject of a complaint that DOL is not following procedures outlined in the Office of Management and Budget's Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices. OMB issued the bulletin to establish procedures for the use of significant guidance documents and, the letter points out, cautioned that ""rules which do not merely interpret existing law or announce tentative policy positions but which establish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with the APA's notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they are initially labeled."" The bulletin also requires an agency to set up an office to receive complaints from the public that the agency is not following procedures in the OMB policy or is improperly treating a significant guidance document as a binding requirement. The bulletin considers guidance ""significant"" when it has a ""broad and substantial impact on regulated parties."" The Mortgage Bankers case was in some respects a win for agencies, in that the court ruled that the APA's notice and comment requirements did not apply to substantial changes to interpretive rules, overturning a longstanding doctrine known as Paralyzed Veterans that evolved from case law in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Republicans note that the Mortgage Bankers ruling recognized the potential for overreach in interpretive rules, with the Supreme Court saying ""there may be times when an agency's decision to issue an interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is driven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment provisions [of the APA]."""
"The National Security Agency and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, have worked to subvert anti-virus and other security software in order to track users and infiltrate networks, according to documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The spy agencies have reverse engineered software products, sometimes under questionable legal authority, and monitored web and email traffic in order to discreetly thwart anti-virus software and obtain intelligence from companies about security software and users of such software. One security software maker repeatedly singled out in the documents is Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, which has a holding registered in the U.K., claims more than 270,000 corporate clients, and says it protects more than 400 million people with its products. British spies aimed to thwart Kaspersky software in part through a technique known as software reverse engineering, or SRE, according to a top-secret warrant renewal request. The NSA has also studied Kaspersky Lab’s software for weaknesses, obtaining sensitive customer information by monitoring communications between the software and Kaspersky servers, according to a draft top-secret report. The U.S. spy agency also appears to have examined emails inbound to security software companies flagging new viruses and vulnerabilities. The efforts to compromise security software were of particular importance because such software is relied upon to defend against an array of digital threats and is typically more trusted by the operating system than other applications, running with elevated privileges that allow more vectors for surveillance and attack. Spy agencies seem to be engaged in a digital game of cat and mouse with anti-virus software companies; the U.S. and U.K. have aggressively probed for weaknesses in software deployed by the companies, which have themselves exposed sophisticated state-sponsored malware. Anti-virus software is an ideal target for a would-be attacker, according to Joxean Koret, a researcher with Coseinc, a Singapore-based information security consultancy. “If you write an exploit for an anti-virus product you’re likely going to get the highest privileges (root, system or even kernel) with just one shot,” Koret told The Intercept in an email. “Anti-virus products, with only a few exceptions, are years behind security-conscious client-side applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the anti-virus products out there.” According to a top-secret GCHQ warrant renewal request written in 2008 and published today by The Intercept, the British spy agency viewed Kaspersky software as an obstruction to its hacking operations and needed to reverse engineer it to find ways to neutralize the problem. Doing so required obtaining a warrant. “Personal security products such as the Russian anti-virus software Kaspersky continue to pose a challenge to GCHQ’s CNE [Computer Network Exploitation] capability and SRE is essential in order to be able to exploit such software and to prevent detection of our activities,” the warrant renewal request said. “Examination of Kaspersky and other such products continues.” The warrant renewal request also states that GCHQ reverse engineers anti-virus programs to assess their fitness for use by government agencies. The requested warrant, provided under Section 5 of the U.K.’s 1994 Intelligence Services Act, must be renewed by a government minister every six months. The document published today is a renewal request for a warrant valid from July 7, 2008 until January 7, 2009. The request seeks authorization for GCHQ activities that “involve modifying commercially available software to enable interception, decryption and other related tasks, or ‘reverse engineering’ software.” Software reverse engineering, or “reversing,” is a collection of techniques for deciphering and analyzing how a program operates. The process can be as simple as observing the flow of data into and out of the program, or as complex as analyzing the machine code — 1s and 0s — to look into the software’s inner workings, including portions of the code that are not explained in the manual or other program documentation. Put simply, it often means taking thousands of commands that instruct the computer exactly what to do and working backwards to translate them into a format that’s more intelligible to a human being. Reversing is a common, often benign practice among software developers that can be used to enable software from different companies to interoperate or to identify security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by third parties. Software makers, fearing piracy, hacking and intellectual property theft, often forbid the practice in licensing agreements and sometimes protect the most sensitive inner workings of their software with encryption. Governments have passed laws, with digital media in mind, that strictly circumscribe tampering with this encryption. Software companies have also sued to block reverse engineering as copyright infringement, arguing that it is illegal to make a copy of a program in violation of their restrictions on such copying. GCHQ felt it needed legal cover to conduct reverse engineering, writing in the warrant renewal application that the practice could otherwise be “unlawful” and amount to “a copyright infringement or breach of contract.” As we explore in a related story today, the warrant is legally questionable on several grounds, in that it applies ISA section 5 to intellectual property for the first time, and GCHQ may be applying ISA section 5 to certain categories of domestic policing. It is unclear what GCHQ accomplished in its analysis of Kaspersky software, but GCHQ has repeatedly reverse engineered software to discover vulnerabilities. Rather than report the vulnerabilities to the companies, spy agencies have quietly stockpiled numerous exploits for a wide range of commercial hardware and software, using them to hack adversaries. The NSA, like GCHQ, has studied Kaspersky Lab’s software for weaknesses. In 2008, an NSA research team discovered that Kaspersky software was transmitting sensitive user information back to the company’s servers, which could easily be intercepted and employed to track users, according to a draft of a top-secret report. The information was embedded in “User-Agent” strings included in the headers of Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, requests. Such headers are typically sent at the beginning of a web request to identify the type of software and computer issuing the request."
"We know swing voters are going extinct because of a political scientist named Corwin Smidt A few years ago, Smidt, who works at Michigan State University, was trying to reconcile two things. One was that there were more and more people identifying as independents, rather than Democrats or Republicans. That should've meant that there were a huge number of people who were willing to change their minds, since they weren't partisan. But Smidt also noticed that over this time period, the presidential election maps didn't change much. It was “much more rigid."" One way to reconcile these two things was to believe that independents were no longer participating, which means there were fewer nonpartisan voters. But Smidt had another question: Are these self-labeled nonpartisans actually willing to vote for Republicans one election and Democrats in another? So he decided to study historical surveys that asks Americans about how they voted. He came up with four groups for the respondents: He did this for every year going back 50 years. What he found was simple, though shocking: Even though more and more people don’t align with a party, they still consistently behave like reliable partisans and repeatedly vote for the same party. In other words, swing voters are dying. Why are swing voters going extinct? Most voters look at where the parties stand on the issues, and then they pick one that best reflects their own views. But if you don’t pay enough attention to tell the parties apart, then you won’t know which party you agree with. That makes you more likely to swing between parties. So if we redraw the picture at the top, it would look like this. Notice how similar the two sides look to her: And it used to be common for people with less political knowledge to switch the party they supported from election to election — whether or not they voted. But over time, this party switching has become far less common: This is because now even low-information voters can tell the two parties apart: Even low-information voters say there’s an important difference between Republicans and Democrats In 1960, both partisans and nonpartisans were much less likely to say there was a big difference between Republicans and Democrats. Now almost all strong partisans would say yes — and even half of nonpartisans would say yes. In short, voters are more confident that they know exactly what they’re voting for when they look at the “D” or the “R” next to a candidate’s name — no matter how partisan they are. And it's not just about partisanship. A modern-day person with low political awareness can tell the parties apart just as well as someone who had high awareness in 1968: How is it that swing voters can now tell the parties apart? Polarization. It's not that the people have changed. Rather, it's the parties. Let's go back to the drawing at the top of the story. Here's where we were in the 1950s, where a low-information voter would look at the parties and not be able to tell the difference. But over the past 50 years, the two parties have evolved very distinct platforms. In the 1968 election, neither Republican Richard Nixon nor Democrat Hubert Humphrey articulated clear views on what he would in Vietnam. ""This ambivalence and deliberate obfuscating can create opportunity to win voters over,"" Smidt said. Before Ronald Reagan, the Republican Party didn't have an anti-abortion position. At the 1996 State of the Union, Bill Clinton said, ""The era of big government is over."" It was a lot harder to pin down each party to specific issues, especially for those who weren't paying close attention. But now the party lines are clear on abortion, taxes, climate change, health care, same-sex marriage — the list goes on. That's why when we look at how much Republicans and Democrats agree in the House and Senate, we see more and more polarization:"
"On the other hand, some have called for a moment of pause, suggesting that we should be wary of overly concrete or introspective analyses of the local, as such accounts inadequately attend to the principal attributes and meaningful bonds of neoliberalism as a global project(Brenner & Theodore, 2002; Peck & Tickell, 2002). The ‘larger conversation’ that neoliberalism provokes is regarded as imperative in connecting similar patterns of experiences across space, which may serve as a potential basis for building solidarities (see Brand & Wissen, 2005;Escobar, 2001; Featherstone, 2005; Kohl, 2006; Routledge, 2003; Springer, 2008, 2011b;Willis, Smith, & Stenning, 2008). Thus neoliberalism as a concept allows poverty and inequality experienced across multiple sites to ﬁnd a point of similitude, whereas disarticulation under-mines efforts to build and sustain shared aims of resistance beyond the micro-politics of the local. Accordingly, conceptualizing neoliberalism requires an appreciation of the elaborate and ﬂuctuating interchange between the local and extra local forces at work within the global political economy (Brenner & Theodore, 2002; Ferguson & Gupta, 2002; Peck, 2001). Ong (2007,p. 3) corroborates this notion by conceptualizing ‘big N Neoliberalism’ as ‘a ﬁxed set of attributes with predetermined outcomes’, while ‘small n neoliberalism’ operates in practice ‘as a logic of governing that mitigates and is selectively taken up in diverse political contexts’. In this light, Peck and Tickell (2002, p. 383) propose ‘a processual conception of neoliberalization as both an “out there” and “in here” phenomenon whose effects are necessarily variegated and uneven, but the incidence and diffusion of which may present clues to a pervasive “metalogic”.Like globalization, neoliberalization should be understood as a process, not an end-state’. Thus, neoliberalism-cum-neoliberalization can be viewed as a plural set of ideas emanating from both everywhere and nowhere within diffused loci of power (Plehwe & Walpen, 2006). The inability to straightforwardly align neoliberalism to particular individuals, organizations, or states, and the further recognition that there is no ‘pure’ or ‘paradigmatic’ version of neoliberalism, but rather a series of geopolitically distinct and institutionally effected hybrids (Peck, 2004),plays a signiﬁcant role in the difﬁculty of realizing consensus on a conceptual deﬁnition of ‘neo-liberalism in general’. Neoliberalism, it would seem is simply too nebulous to isolate or deter-mine"

"Tribal rights to water are firmly established, although for any tribe, claiming such rights is an arduous, lengthy, and expensive process. Still, the model — one that resulted in 32 settlements approved by Congress — has a large role for the tribes and others who rely on a common water resource. If settlement is not achievable in such cases, litigation is always an option, and the tribes (with substantial federal support) have generally done well in such litigation. In the case of environmental habitat protection like that at stake in the DAPL controversy, however, there is no settlement model. Tribal input into most projects affecting tribal lands and water is advisory only. Unlike the water rights situation, where tribes and the federal government are usually allied, tribes dissatisfied with a federal project or permitting decision are left to battle against the United States alone. The DAPL experience shows the shortcomings in this approach and should serve as a springboard for changes in federal law. Tribes should be afforded more influence in federal permitting decisions that will affect tribal land, water and people. It is not enough to be consulted if the permitting agency is free to reject tribal input subject to deferential judicial review. The Supreme Court could fix the problem by limiting its narrow interpretation of the tribal trust to the Tucker Act cases, and requiring that agency actions comply with a substantive trust obligation to recognize and protect tribal interests. And, of course, Congress has paramount authority that it should exercise due to its solemn obligations to Indian nations."
"U.S. national security suffered in 2017. Russia is running amok, allies are losing faith in American security and prosperity commitments, and the liberal order is in crisis. Surrounding these clouds, however, a silver lining stands out: counterterrorism. U.S. counterterrorism proved successful this year, especially against jihadist movements that have plagued the United States and the world since 9/11. Jihadist terrorism still poses a problem, of course, and other forms of terrorism have risen too in intensity, but a look at the terrorism balance sheet for 2017 shows a net positive. Yet, the U.S. disengagement from the Middle East provides fertile soil for terrorist groups to grow. Long-term counterterrorism success requires a reexamination of U.S. policy in the Middle East at large. The collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate in Iraq and Syria represents the biggest counterterrorism success. The Islamic State will go underground and otherwise try to adapt, but losing their territory dealt a big blow: only three years ago, the group seemed deeply rooted in Iraq and Syria and was metastasizing in Egypt, Libya and other countries in the Muslim world. In addition to the U.S. assault on the Islamic State’s territory, the group’s virtual presence is under siege due to counterterrorism efforts, with both the quality and quantity of its propaganda suffering. Even with the collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate, so-called “homegrown violent extremists” (HVEs) will likely attack, the group will strive to restore itself in Iraq and Syria, and frustrated, would-be foreign fighters may also strike. Some of the Islamic State’s thousands of foreign fighters will also return home, posing an additional danger. Regardless, the collapse of the caliphate dealt a big blow to Islamic State. Setting aside the fall of the caliphate, the counterterrorism picture looks positive from the perspective of U.S. homeland security. In 2017, nine people died on U.S. soil from jihadist terrorist attacks (a security guard killed in Denver, two Americans and six foreign tourists, killed during the car-ramming attack in New York City). That’s nine too many but it should not obscure that the overall number is low. This low number probably stems from a mix of strong U.S. counterterrorism measures abroad, aggressive investigations and better defenses at home, and the overall weakness of jihadist networks in the United States."
"Food & Water Watch advocates instead for better fresh water management practices. ""Ocean desalination hides the growing water supply problem instead of focusing on water management and lowering water usage,"" the group reports, citing a recent study which found that California can meet its water needs for the next 30 years by implementing cost-effective urban water conservation. Desalination is ""an expensive, speculative supply option that will drain resources away from more practical solutions,"" the group says.¶ Despite such arguments, the practice is becoming more common. Ted Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council says that more than 12,000 desalination plants already supply fresh water in 120 nations, mostly in the Middle East and Caribbean. And analysts expect the worldwide market for desalinated water to grow significantly over the coming decades. Environmental advocates may just have to settle for pushing to ""green"" the practice as much as possible in lieu of eliminating it altogether."
"Honesty compels us to admit, then, that we have been living in a classic ordeal, a classic test of initiation. We have had no choice; yet we may now turn this necessity into a virtue. For if our goal is to build and attain a new level on which to live, we must put ourselves into such an initiatory situation. Every transition to a new spiritual level demands the death of the old. For every higher level is a level of wider integration and greater wholeness, leaving behind a level of relative fragmentation. Thus we must allow ourselves to experience a dissolution of the parts of our lives, so that a new synthesis can be created. Certainly this must be true if wholeness is the meaning of the fourth level. And only in a direct confrontation with death can such a dissolution and merger be experienced. This is the evidence of religious traditions throughout the world. If we want to build a fourth level, we must accept and even embrace our initiatory experience as something positive. Of course we must also recognize that we have not completed the process; our three decade initiatory chaos is still upon us, and only we ourselves can choose to complete the process. Nevertheless, we are en route, and it is the Bomb itself that has made this possible. Our initiations must be in some sense individual and private, but they must also be done in community; society as a whole must undergo the experience. Hence we can learn our path not only from the myth of the individual hero but also from the myth of the heroic rebirth of whole peoples, even of the whole world. Indeed we have such a myth, kept alive for us by the Bomb, in the tradition of the apocalypse. We can learn something valuable from this tradition too. We can learn that our initiation must be acted out in real history—in the empirical reality of the political, social, and cultural world. And we can learn that no matter how bad things may be now, they must get worse before they get better. ‘The chaos of today must be intensified; death must be given Its full due before new life can begin. We must face more honestly and more deeply the distortions in our lives—the insecurity of a fragmented and chaotic world whose survival hangs on such a slim thread. In doing so, we must admit that we feel ourselves living in desperate times and immersed to   some degree or other in feelings of despair. Joanna Rogers Macy has written eloquently on this subject, showing how our numbing leads us to repress the despair that must arise from an honest assessment of our situation: “This refusal of feeling takes a heavy toll The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative uses.”2 Macy suggests that we must allow ourselves to feel this despair if our life energy is to be freed again; this opening up of despair, as she describes it, clearly has initiatory dimensions. For in feeling the depth of our despair we may, in fact, “disintegrate.” But this is “positive disintegration”: “It is helpful in despair work to realize that going to pieces or falling apart is not such a bad thing. Indeed, it is as essential to evolutionary and psychic transformation as the cracking of outgrown shells, ... Our ‘going to pieces,’ however uncomfortable a process, can open us up to new perception, new data, new response.... There is healing in such openness, for ourselves and perhaps for the world.”3 In admitting our craziness, we must face our despair. And In facing despair, we deepen our craziness. Yet it is a necessary part of our initiation. We may also, temporarily, deepen our numbing. In any “positive disintegration” there is resistance, a natural refusal of the psyche to fall apart, and thus there is refusal to feel, But this, too, may have to be accepted as necessary, with trust that it is merely temporary and that those who accept the need to transcend their present state will transcend the numbing as well, Every facet of our “death in life” must be tasted to its fullest. In order to “imagine the real” we must open ourselves to the feelings of total craziness, total despair, and total numbing, as moments on our way to the fourth level.‚- This painful necessity points back to the central importance of symbolism Macy writes: “To acknowledge and express our despair, we need images and symbols….Exercise of the imagination is especially necessary, because existing verbal constructs seem inadequate to what many of us are sensing…we are groping in the dark, with shattered beliefs and faltering hopes, and we need images for this phase if we are to work through it.” While the Bomb shows us once again our need for symbolic images, it also shows us that we may already have the images we need. For what better image of despair is there than the image of nuclear war itself? What better image of madness and of “death in life” than nuclear catastrophe? But the problem we have consistently encountered is the relatively unthreatening and even appealing elements in all these images. And it may be that all such images of chaos, expressing numinous power and the coincidence of opposites in the big whoosh, must inevitably have attractive aspects. Yet there may be some which come closer to reflecting the total horror of nuclear war. These are the images we must agree to face if we are to confront our despair and the reality that lurks behind it."
"Building on the preceding discussion of mechanisms, this section assesses the specific current ways in which U.S. oil dependence could reduce its security; the following section considers the implications of other states’ oil dependence for U.S. security. Some of the mechanism do not come into play here—the United States is not vulnerable to a major power cutting access to its oil and undermining its military capability; nor does the United States need to pursue military policies to protect its access to oil that would threaten a major power and fuel a security dilemma. Instead, protection of the U.S. economy underpins the key scenarios in which the United States might use force. This section explores three prosperity-based possibilities: 1) Iranian closing of the Strait of Hormuz requires U.S. intervention; 2) a cutoff of Saudi oil requires U.S. intervention; and 3) an energy-driven NATO alliance with Georgia increases the probability of conflict with Russia. In addition, the section reviews the arguments about the relationship between U.S. oil dependence and the threat posed by al Qaeda. Intervening to protect U.S. prosperity—Iran and the Strait of Hormuz Energy dependence could draw the United States into a conflict in which a regional power was interrupting, or threatening to interrupt, the flow of oil. The economic costs of a disruption would determine whether the costs of fighting were justified. Similarly, the potential economic costs of a disruption would determine whether U.S. foreign and military policy should be devoted to deterring states from interrupting the flow of oil; more precisely, these economic costs would determine how much the United States should invest in the policies required for deterrence. Given the geographical distribution of oil, such a conflict would likely occur in the Persian Gulf. The greatest danger is probably posed by Iran—the Iraq War has greatly increased Iran’s power relative to Iraq, and Iran is acquiring improved missile capabilities and making progress toward having the capability to build nuclear weapons. The most disruptive Iranian action would be closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which the vast majority of Persian Gulf oil must pass. Having identified the danger posed by dependence on oil that transits this strait (as well as the Strait of Malacca), a recent Council on Foreign Relations study concluded that the “United States should take the lead in building an infrastructure protection program that would be based on practical steps by relevant countries and address critical infrastructures and transit routes. Initial efforts should focus on joint planning, technical assistance, and military exercises, especially involving naval units operating near ports or along critical sea-lanes.” Although difficult to estimate the probability that Iran would attempt to close the strait, analysts have offered reasons for expecting the probability to be quite low: Iran would lose the oil revenue from its own exports; and Iran would likely be deterred by the probable costs of U.S. intervention, which could include the destruction of key military bases and occupation of some of its territory. Because so much oil flows through the strait, the United States would almost certainly respond to keep it open. Nevertheless, there are plausible scenarios in which Iran blocks the strait, for example, as retaliation for an attack against is nuclear weapons program or as a coercive measure if losing a conventional war. Careful analysis suggests that the United States would prevail, but that a successful campaign could take many weeks or more, and that oil prices would increase significantly during this period. Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would increase the risk of this scenario in two basic ways. First, Iran might believe that the possibility of escalation to nuclear weapons would deter the United States from responding, making Iran more willing to interrupt tanker traffic. Although basic deterrence logic says this calculation points in the correct direction, the United States might nevertheless intervene. The United States would question Iran’s willingness to escalate to nuclear use because America’s far larger and more capable nuclear forces would pose a formidable retaliatory threat. In addition, the United States would have incentives to make clear that possession of a small number of nuclear weapons by a much weaker state would not deter the United States from using conventional weapons in a limited war. Being deterred by the Iranian nuclear force would suggest that small nuclear arsenals provide tremendous potential for launching conventional aggression. As Barry Posen argued in a related context (the counterfactual case in which Iraq possessed nuclear weapons before deciding to invade Kuwait), “If the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait is permitted to stand, nuclear weapons will come to be viewed as a shield that protects conventional conquests from any challenger, including a great power heavily armed with its own nuclear weapons.” Consequently, the United States would have incentives to respond to Iranian aggression both to preserve its ability to deter conventional aggression by small nuclear states and to support its nonproliferation policy. Second, once a conventional conflict occurred, there would be the danger that U.S. conventional operations could increase the probability nuclear war. A number of paths are possible. The U.S. mine clearing operation required to open the strait would likely be accompanied by attacks against land-based Iranian targets. The United States would want to destroy the land-based anti-ship cruise missiles that Iran could use to threaten U.S. mine clearing ships; in addition, the United States would want to destroy Iranian air defenses that could be used to protect these missiles. These U.S. strikes would require large numbers of carrier-based aircraft flying sorties over a period of a few weeks or more. If Iran lacked confidence that U.S. aims were limited, it could feel compelled to put its nuclear forces on alert to increase their survivability, which would increase the probability of accidental or unauthorized nuclear attack. The United States could then have incentives to attack Iran’s nuclear force, either preemptively because it believed Iran was preparing to launch an attack or preventively because it faced a closing window of opportunity after which Iran’s nuclear forces would be survivable. A more subtle danger is the possibility of inadvertent nuclear escalation resulting from a situation in which Iranian leaders decide to escalate because they believe, incorrectly, that the United States has decided to destroy their nuclear force (or ability to launch it). U.S. conventional operations could create this danger by destroying Iranian radars, and command and control systems, leaving Iranian leaders unable to assess the U.S. conventional campaign and fearing that the United States was preparing to launch a full-scale invasion or a conventional attack against their nuclear forces."
"Unfortunately, after numerous investigations, Congressional hearings, and the finding of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling (Oil Spill Commission) that the disaster’s “root causes are systemic and, absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur,” the stage is set for a repeat performance. If a similar disaster happened today, there’s no guarantee that we wouldn’t get the same result: oil covered beaches and wetlands, oil drenched birds and sea turtles, millions of gallons of toxic dispersants introduced into the environment and our food chain, a fishing industry struggling to survive, and a mass die off of dolphins. “Trust us,” said the oil and gas industry before the BP disaster, “Our blowout preventers will work and we can clean up any spilled oil before it seriously impacts the environment.” Today, the oil and gas industry continues to ask for our trust, even though the design flaw in the Cameron-style blowout preventers that was identified in the BOEMRE-commissioned technical report still exists, and even though the undersea containment systems that the industry and BOEM are relying on to cap a wild well quickly have not been tested at the depths and pressures of current and proposed deepwater wells. The Helix system has been tested on a tabletop in Houston, but the tabletop was not under water. On the government side, while the Department of Interior has embraced some significant reforms (for example, creating the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to enforce safety and environmental regulations ostensibly immune from pressures to expand oil and gas production and maximize government revenues), the government agency charged with overseeing oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), continues to make critical decisions on expanding oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico without site-specific analyses of the risks to the environment and human health."
An influential group of House Republicans aims to dismantle the National School Lunch Program and the improved nutritional standards that first lady Michelle Obama advocated.
"Earlier this year, Russian Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev told Russian state news that two Typhoon-class submarines--Arkhangelsk and Severstal--could re-enter service after a deep refit, notably including a weapons suite upgrade to over 200 Kalibr cruise missiles: “the dimensions of each of these submarines allows them to be armed with at least 200 [Kalibr] cruise missiles each.” Burtsev’s proposal drew its share of skepticism, centered around cost and practicality concerns. It now appears that Russia’s Northern Fleet plans to give at least one of its Typhoon submarines a new lease on life, though not quite in the way that Burtsev intended. Dmitri Donskoi, the first Typhoon-class vessel and the largest submarine in the world, served for the past decade as an RSM-56 Bulava ballistic missile testbed. In 2018, it was announced that Donskoi will undergo a deep refit to join the upcoming Borei line as one of two Russian submarine classes to deploy Bulava missiles. Earlier this week, the press office of Russia’s Northern Fleet announced that Donskoi has completed combat trials in the White Sea. It is unclear if a similar fate awaits Arkhangelsk and Severstal, which were decommissioned in the mid 2000’s and have sat in a Severodvinsk repair port ever since. But even if Donskoi will be the only one to receive this treatment, serious logistical problems persist. Not only is there a heavy upfront bill to refitting as old and large a vessel as Donskoi, but the maintenance costs of a modernized Typhoon submarine would far exceed that of its much smaller and leaner Borei counterparts. What does the Russian Navy stand to gain from such a daunting and expensive project, involving everything from titanium derusting to nuclear reactor replacement? Prestige, for one. Typhoon is arguably the most feared and renowned submarine line ever constructed by Russia or its Soviet predecessor state; a household name from such classic films as the Hunt for Red October, but also a genuinely potent centerpiece of the Soviet SLBM arsenal from 1981 onward. There is, however, a technical case for refitting at least one Typhoon vessel. Russia’s emerging modernization model of a lean, local, rapid-response force may be a cost-effective way to guarantee the integrity of Russia’s sprawling coastlines but has increasingly left the Russian Navy without a maritime means of conducting saturation strikes in a high intensity combat setting. Burtsev notes that Russia’s current submarine lineup compares unflatteringly with the refitted US Ohio-class submarines, capable of fielding a whopping 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. He adds that even Russia’s surface ships, like the new Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, struggle to match this volume of firepower; the aging, heavily armed Kirov-class Petr Velikiy “battlecruiser” is the sole exception."
"As described in DOE’s September 2020 report, “U.S. Oil and Natural Gas: Providing Energy Security and Supporting Our Quality of Life”, oil and natural gas play an essential role in modern life that extends beyond the commonly associated transportation fuel, home heating and electricity generation. 73 Oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are the foundational elements and raw materials in manufacturing a range of consumer products, including plastic goods. Especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids are key raw materials in the manufacture of plastic medical supplies and personal protective equipment like masks, ventilators, vaccine vials, and syringes. Further, fertilizers that increase annual crop yields are produced from dry natural gas, and lightweight modern plastics that increase fuel economy and vehicle safety are produced from natural gas liquids. The surge in U.S. oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production has given domestic manufacturers a competitive advantage, reducing key input costs to manufacture everyday goods. Yet, in a hydraulic fracturing ban scenario, this key American manufacturing advantage would be greatly diminished, setting back advancements made in domestic manufacturing. In fact, with oil and natural gas intertwined throughout virtually all aspects of the economy, the consequences of reduced production would reverberate throughout the U.S. and global economy. While a ban on hydraulic fracturing would directly and negatively impact oil and natural gas sector jobs, broader, less apparent consequences could exist in developing hydrogen-based energy, public and higher education funding, and even wind and solar development."
"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee on June 5 approved a budget bill that would give the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about $5.4 billion in 2015, including some $2.1 billion for its major weather satellite programs — a small increase over 2014 that is about even with the White House’s 2015 request and what House appropriators included in a competing bill approved in May.¶ Senate and House appropriators now seem to be more or less on the same page when it comes to the weather agency’s 2015 budget, even if they do not agree fully with the White House — or each other — on every detail.¶ Senate appropriators, like their counterparts in the House, agreed to give NOAA’s two major weather satellite programs the roughly $130 million boost the White House requested in March. That comes out to about $916 million for the Joint Polar Satellite System, some $95 million more than 2014, and about $981 million for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R, roughly $39 million more than 2014. The second Joint Polar Satellite System spacecraft is slated to launch in 2017 — a testbed satellite launched in 2011 was pressed into service as the program’s first — while the next geostationary satellite would lift off in 2016.¶ Likewise, both Senate and House appropriators have now directed NASA to take over full development responsibility for the Jason-3 ocean altimetry satellite and the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), stripping NOAA management of their role in the development process, but keeping the weather agency in charge of on-orbit operations."
"Before analyzing the benefits and costs of communications surveillance, I want to address some common misperceptions relating to its history, rationale, and efficacy. The first misperception is that communications surveillance is a new phenomenon. In reality it has a long history. Prior to the nineteenth century, communication pivoted around the horse and rider (and the roads on which they traversed) and around boats (and the ports at which their voyages began and ended). From the tenth century BCE through to the fifteenth century CE these modes of communication were subject to rudimentary forms of surveillance: messengers were intercepted and bags were opened; ports were embargoed and ships were searched. This pattern changed as European states, increasingly administered by professionals and reliably funded by taxes, took shape. This is when we first hear of “spymasters” like John Thurloe, secretary to the English Commonwealth's Council of State, who established in 1653 a Secret Office that opened, copied, and resealed suspicious letters over the course of a night. The innovation was adopted by the Stuarts and then expanded by the Hanoverians, making it one of the first organizations dedicated to communications surveillance."
"Jan. 30 (UPI) -- The U.S. State Department has approved Japan's $2.15 billion purchase of two land-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense systems. On Tuesday, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale. Defense News reported it was the first foreign military sales announcement since the end of a 35-day partial government shutdown. The Defense Department was not closed during the shutdown, but the State Department, which was shuttered, needed to approve the deal. Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems is the primary contractor for the Aegis Weapon System and Multi-Mission Signal Processors. General Dynamics will provide the Command and Control Processor Refresh. Also included are radio navigation equipment, ordnance, IFF systems, and construction services for six vertical launch system launcher module enclosures. ""This proposed sale will provide the government of Japan with an enhanced capability against increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile threats and create an expanded, layered defense of its homeland,"" the State Department said in a news release. ""Japan, which already has the AEGIS in its inventory, will have no difficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces."" The State Department noted the United States must assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability, especially against North Korea. In addition, the arms ""will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region."" To fund the systems, Japan's defense budget will grow to $47 billion in fiscal 2019, starting in April, the government announced last month. Japan already has the seventh-largest defense budget in the world, and it's about 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Conversely, China and the United States spend between 2 and 3 percent of their gross domestic products annually on defense. On Jan. 20, Japan's Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya visited a U.S. Defense Department facility on Kauai island, Hawaii, the test site for the Aegis Ashore land-based missile interception system. He was given information on the missile system's functionality. ""I am convinced that introducing Aegis Ashore will strengthen our defense capabilities against a missile attack,"" Iwaya said to the media after visiting the facility. ""We will steadily proceed with introduction of the system."" The government plans to deploy the systems in Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures. Akita Prefecture is in northwestern Honshu on the Sea of Japan coast with about 308,000 people. ""Why the Defense Ministry chose Araya as a site for Aegis Ashore is a mystery,"" Kozo Kazama, who leads a local group opposed to the Aegis plan, told Japan Times. ""Unlike the other candidate site in Yamaguchi, which is located away from a major urban center, Araya is in a major city. ""There are so many concerns about the effects of the radar on both electronic devices in the area and on stress levels, as well as all sorts of security concerns related to the presence of missiles so close to so many people,"" Kazama said. In August, Defense Ministry officials told Akita residents about 200 personnel, as well as radar facilities and missile launchers, would be stationed at the Aegis Ashore site. At the other site, the town of Abu lies deep in the Yamaguchi Prefecture countryside, about a 30-minute drive from the port city of Hagi. ""There are concerns about radio waves from the Aegis radar and whether cellphone reception and television sets would be affected,"" said Sumiko Hara, 75, one of the leaders of the local opposition. And you can't say that there's been a sufficient investigation into the effects of the Aegis Ashore on human health."" Also, part of the area is classified as an active volcano zone, including a lava plateau. ""Unfortunately, as this is a Defense Ministry project, the local governments are limited in what they can do and the central government can keep much information secret,"" said Rota Asai, a member of the Hagi Municipal Assembly. On Tuesday, James H. Anderson, the assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities, outlined the U.S. missile defense strategy during a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Anderson said the strategy covers lethality, partnership and reform. He noted in the presentation that China and Russia are developing advanced cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons that can potentially overcome U.S. defenses. To address regional threats and protect partner nations, the United States has looked to deploy additional missile defense assets, including both Patriot and Aegis systems as ""partner nations are building up their air and missile defenses, with the possibility of integrating them with U.S. systems"" -- including those deployed or under construction in Romania, Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands. ""Diplomacy and deterrence are the primary strategies to protect the nation, deployed forces and U.S. allies from missile attacks,"" according to a Defense Department summary of the presentation. ""Should that fail, the U.S. is developing a layered missile defense system as well as offensive capability."""
"First of all, in the midst of weakening family and community structures, adolescents tend to perceive that joining a fighting force may offer them better opportunities to fulfill their social and psychological needs-such as the need to be seen as worthy and capable individuals with access to resources and power. For males, engagement with fighting forces tend to provide opportunities to attain the ‘masculine’ status that is much prized amongst peers. For others, social and economic stagnation and the loss of education opportunities lure them to military recruitment. In such a situation, peer pressure usually plays a significant role in stimulating the desire to enlist. Adolescents who are separated from their families have moved out of their communities tend to succumb to peer pressure more easily. For their part, those who recruit adolescents often do so by promising them social power and economic opportunities that are lacking in their communities."
"The confusing nature of the term “criminal justice reform” also contributes to how voters rank this issue compared with other more commonly understood priorities. The survey asked respondents to describe in a few words what the term itself means to them. Responses varied widely, from ideas about sentencing reform and the drug war to more abstract discussions about justice and fairness to more counterintuitive opinions that the term meant increasing punishment and jail time for offenders."
"Russia and Japan are moving towards a rapprochement after a long period of mutual antipathy. In recent days, Moscow and Tokyo have started to discuss increased cooperation in the naval arena. And, in time, there could be a settlement between the two powers over the Kuril Islands, which came under Soviet jurisdiction after the end of the Second World War, but which Japan wants returned."
"It is essential, however, that the search for such alternatives take for a point of departure the contemporary world situation, which is no longer to be grasped in terms of past conceptualizations. While it is necessary to view contemporary ide­ologies of globalization critically, we can ill afford to overlook that they address contemporary challenges that are quite real. Especially important in this regard is the conceptualization of the world in terms of the Three Worlds idea. In past days, the Three Worlds idea provided a significant means to grasp global economic and political configurations. As late as the 1970s, the idea of the Third World pointed to certain concrete forms of economic exploitation and political struggle. By the 1 980s, the struggle part of the meaning had lost its salience, rendering the Third World synonymous with backward or undeveloped, which also suggested a return to the original post—World-War-Il use of the term. The Third World, which ear­lier had been a location of possible alternatives to both First World capitalist and Second World statist modernities, came increasingly to denote those areas in the world that were falling behind in the race of progress. At the same time, economic developments associated with globalization further scrambled the tenuous bound­aries between the Three Worlds. The fall for all practices of statist socialist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 was the final event to render irrelevant earlier concep­tualizations of global configurations. With global capitalism has emerged a situation that not only signals an end to the Three Worlds idea, but even more radically to the dichotomization of the world around East/West or North/South distinctions. What are gone are not only concepts for organizing the world, but also concepts that served to give coherence to projects of emancipation. The irrelevance of the concepts, however, does not imply the disappearance of fundamental aspects of the situation that the concepts encompassed, especially the divisions between rich and poor, and the conditions of inequality, oppression, and exploitation, which are perhaps sharper today than in the past.1’ The problem with contemporary alternatives to the Three Worlds idea—globalization, postmod­ernism, and postcolonialism—is not that they do not articulate a new situation, but that they turn their backs on the persistent material and cultural problems created by the globalization of capitalism. Such Third World issues—which are no longer confined to a geographical Third World—are literally absent from discussions of modernity and postmodernity; as such discussions appear as “an all-Western debate; an Occidental quiz, with Western answers to Western questions.”’2 The problems these discussions present are not abstractly intellectual but pro­foundly pedagogical, with implications for everyday social ideologies. Students— especially those who are nourished by Western academic culture—are often caught in a situation where postmodem and postcolonial theories substitute for knowledge about other countries, knowledge of languages, and most certainly knowledge of other theories. To a degree this book is addressed to these students. The authors must assume that “it is not possible for anyone to stand outside either their mater­ial reality (both human and nonhuman) or of the evolving context of ideas.” ide­ally, “one must operate taking cognizance of how the available alternatives will affect human beings living in the particular world of the present.”’3 Postmodernism and postcolonialism encourage preoccupation with identity and subjectivity, but only by displacing into the realm of culture the kind of self-knowledge that comes with the confrontation of historically circumscribed material realities. The end result is, on the one hand, not so much self-knowledge as the denial of the possi­bility of knowledge of any kind and the re-reification of identities that produces a liberal relativism, and on the other hand, murderous separation of human beings. To overcome this new mode of culturalism in both its liberal and conservative man­ifestations, it is necessary once again to confront life in all its materiality, which unites as well as divides humans across the globe. To this end, the various chapters in this book reaffirm the historicity of the present to spell out the material context that produces contemporary cultures and ideologies, including the contemporary crisis of history. Similarly, the alternative historiographies the chapters propose insist on the persistence of past problems while recognizing the changed circumstances of the present; hence the title, History after the Three Worlds, which parts with the Three Worlds idea but reaffirms it as the historical condition of the present."
"Although the Rule of Lenity “is perhaps not much less old than construction itself,”144 great disagreement persists as to the underlying purpose it serves.145 Some contend that lenity reinforces the same “fair notice” values that underlie the void for vagueness doctrine.146 This rationale, as many observe, is essentially a legal fiction and cannot withstand “critical examination.”147 For one thing, “criminals do not read statutes.”148 For another, interpretive tools that can preclude a conclusion of statutory ambiguity (judicial gloss and the polices behind the law, to name a few) “hardly provide notice „in language that the common world will understand‟”149 of what the law condemns. The Rule of Lenity, in other words, “substantially underprotects the interest in fair notice.”150"
"But since 1988, when education policy shifted away from desegregation efforts, the reading test score gap has grown — to 26 points in 2012 — with segregated schooling increasing in every region of the country. Research has shown that integration is a critical factor in narrowing the achievement gap. In a 2010 research review, Harvard University’s Susan Eaton noted that racial segregation in schools has such a severe impact on the test score-gap that it outweighs the positive effects of a higher family income for minority students. Further, a 2010 study of students’ improvements in math found that the level of integration was the only school characteristic (vs. safety and community commitment to math) that significantly affected students’ learning growth."
"“(a) Quarterly Reports.—Beginning on January 15, 1992, and quarterly thereafter through October 15, 1993, the President shall submit to the relevant congressional committees a report— “(1) describing the progress in implementing the purposes of the multilateral arms transfer and control regime as described in section 402(b); and “(2) describing efforts by the United States and progress made to induce other countries to curtail significantly the volume of their arms sales to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, and if such efforts were not made, the justification for not making such efforts."
"Heidegger's work is a call to reflect, to think in some way other than calculatively, technologically, pragmatically. Once we begin to move with and into Heidegger's call and begin to see our trying to seize control and solve problems as itself a problematic approach, if we still believe that thinking's only real purpose is to function as a prelude to action, in attempting to think we will only twist within the agonizing grip of paradox, feeling pure frustration, unable to conceive of ourselves as anything but paralysed. However, as so many peoples before us have known, paradox is not only a trap; it is also a scattering point and a passageway. Paradox invites examination of its own constitution (hence of the patterns of thinking within which it occurs) and thereby breaks a way of thinking open, revealing the configurations of power that propel it and hold it on track. And thus it sometimes makes possible the dissipation of that power and the deflection of thinking into new paths and new possibilities. If we read him seriously and listen genuinely, Heidegger frustrates us. At a time when the stakes are so very high and decisive action is so loudly and urgently called for, when the ice caps are melting and the bird flu is spreading and the president is selling off our national wilderness reserves to private contractors for quick private gain, Heidegger apparently calls us to do - nothing. When things that matter so much are hanging in the balance, this frustration quickly turns to anger and disgust and even furor. How dare this man, who might legitimately be accused of having done nothing right himself at a crucial time in his own nation's history, elevate quietism to a philosophical principle? Responsible people have to act, surely, and to suggest anything else is to side with the forces of destruction and short-sighted greed. If we get beyond the revulsion and anger that Heidegger's call may initially inspire and actually examine the feasibility of response, we may move past the mere frustration of our moral desires and begin to undergo frustration of another kind, the philosophical frustration that is attendant on paradox. How is it possible, we ask, to choose, to will, to do nothing? Heidegger is not consecrating quietism. His call places in question the bimodal logic of activity and passivity; it points out the paradoxical nature of our passion for action, our passion for maintaining control. What is the origin of that drive? Is that drive itself really un- der our control? Is it something we choose and will, or it is something whose origins and meanings transcend us? The call itself suggests that our drive for acting decisively and forcefully is part of what must be thought through, that the narrow option of will versus surrender is one of the power configurations of current thinking that must be allowed to dissipate"
"As European nations decide how staunchly to oppose Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, they have been pondering uneasily the prospect that Moscow could cut off the Russian natural gas supplies upon which many of them depend. Foreign policy specialists across the transatlantic community have scurried to promote ideas, such as a US promise to export gas to Europe, to reduce Russia’s leverage.¶ Some bad news for this effort is that, across much of Eastern Europe, from Bohemia to the Black Sea, Russia holds a second ace in the energy politics game: nuclear fuel. Five countries – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine – rely almost entirely on Russian state-owned companies to fuel their nuclear power plants. For these 80 million Europeans, the Russian state provides services essential to some 42 percent of electricity production."
"This afternoon the Senate voted 68-32 to pass its sweeping immigration reform bill. The bill is a solid improvement over the current immigration system. It legalizes most of the unlawful immigrants here and provides larger pathways for legal immigration in the future. The bill does have flaws – many of which I’ve written about in detail. It doesn’t increase lawful immigration enough. The guest worker visa programs for lower skilled workers are too small, restricted to certain sectors of the economy, and governed by confusing bureaucracy. Under today’s immigration rules, very few of our ancestors would have been able to immigrate here legally. The Senate’s immigration bill takes us a small step closer to our traditionally more open immigration policy. It shovels gargantuan amounts of security resources toward the southern border in an attempt to halt future unlawful immigration that could otherwise cheaply be halted with an expanded guest worker visa program. The border “surge,” as many are calling it, is truly embarrassing, especially for a country with such proud immigrant traditions. There are certainly legitimate security concerns, but the extra enforcement will just drive up the price of smuggling and marginally decrease unlawful immigration of peaceful workers at enormous cost."
"As far back as the early 1990s, Washington thought trade and investment eventually would make China more democratic. In the past couple of years, though, the Communist Party has doubled down on repression at home and become more aggressive overseas. In short, things have not turned out as Washington had hoped, and relations between the world's two major powers are tense these days. President Obama will continue to work on that tricky relationship after he arrives in Beijing on Monday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The gathering provides Chinese President Xi Jinping with an international platform as he hosts leaders from Japan, India and Russia and tries to boost China's standing in world affairs. Prosperity's Unexpected Consequences Two decades ago, Republicans, Democrats and some prominent China scholars argued that economic engagement would change China's political system over time. ""By working with China and expanding areas of cooperation, dealing forthrightly with our differences, we can advance fundamental American interests and values,"" President Bill Clinton said in 1997. James Mann, author of The China Fantasy: Why Capitalism Will Not Bring Democracy to China, says the conventional wisdom was China's authoritarian system naturally would evolve. ""Part of the theory was, it was just inevitable,"" says Mann, a scholar-in-residence at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""Any country that became prosperous and had growing trade and investment ties with the world would automatically liberalize."" One popular U.S. columnist argued that as Chinese enjoyed greater and greater consumer choices — such as various types of coffee at Starbucks — a desire for political choice would follow. After meeting with then-premier Wen Jiabao in 2005, then-U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters China was heading towards a more open political system. ""The whole basis of the discussion I have had in a country that is developing very fast — where 100 million people now use the Internet, and which is going to be the second-largest economy in the world — is that there is an unstoppable momentum toward greater political freedom,"" Blair told reporters in Beijing, according to Bloomberg News. But Mann says capitalism had the opposite effect. ""It resulted in a rich, authoritarian regime, which is not what we were looking for in the first place, and which is more of a problem to deal with,"" he says. China has poured some of its riches into naval power and is now tangling with Japan and the Philippines, close American allies, over disputed islands. China claims most of the vast South China Sea as its own, despite the protests of various neighbors. Mann says American policymakers thought China would follow the path of other East Asian dictatorships, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which democratized in the 1980s. Those countries, however, relied on the U.S. for their defense, which Washington used as political leverage. ""The United States pushed Taiwan over a decade,"" says Mann. ""None of that is going to happen in China. It has an entirely different relationship with the United States."" Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, says that instead of democratizing China, economic growth helped the party strengthen its grip on power. ""The U.S. has gravely underestimated the capabilities, the determination, the resourcefulness of the Chinese Communist Party. Better economic performance gives them greater political legitimacy, and [then] they don't have to do political reform,"" says Pei. It also ""allows them more resources to use repression to defend one-party rule."" Since coming to power in 2012, President Xi has cracked down on Internet speech and jailed all sorts of critics. Last month, an 81-year-old writer known by the pen name Tie Liu was charged with ""creating a disturbance."" Among his apparent offenses: publishing the accounts of some of the political victims of Mao Zedong, who died in 1976. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, knows China's political failings, but says the party has made improvements for which it doesn't receive credit. Those include term limits for top leaders, who — though not popularly elected — pay close attention to public opinion. ""America somehow is impatient,"" says Shen, who says Americans seem to think the only form of democracy is the one-person, one-vote Western model. America ""is too idealistic and is too chauvinistic."" Trends That Undermine Communist Power How long can the Communist Party stay in power? Pei expects it to run out of gas in 10 to 15 years. ""The people who work for this system have no fundamental loyalty to the system,"" says Pei. Indeed, the conventional wisdom among Chinese themselves is that most people who have joined the party in the past decade primarily did so to enrich themselves through connections and graft. ""All they want to do is benefit personally from their relationship with the system,"" Pei continues. ""So, over the long run, the system will go bankrupt."""
"In their recent critical review of contemporary discourses of citizenship, Knight Abowitz and Harnish (2006) conclude that liberal citizenship discourses are with civic republicanism the two dominant discourses in K–12 curricular and policy texts. In particular, liberal discourses prioritize individual rights and equality for exercising freedom. As Knight Abowitz and Harnish explain, freedom from the tyranny of authority and the deliberative values of discussion are viewed as the two primary values in this discourse. A significant focus of this discourse is also on learning the values and skills necessary to take part in a multicultural society. In multicultural societies in which immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers constitute an important component of culturally diverse public life, “schools perennially create and recreate citizens and the nation” (p. 664). An additional question, then, that may be raised at this point is: How do liberal discourses of citizenship treat the representations of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as fearsome individuals?"
"China was the only member nation on the Security Council to abstain from a resolution to condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea. But analysts say Beijing's support for Moscow faces limits. ""On one hand, Russia's strong-arm tactics and meddling in Ukraine are at odds with China's long-standing commitment to the inviolability of state sovereignty,"" said Benjamin Herscovitch , a research fellow with Australia's Centre for Independent Studies. ""On the other hand, Moscow's disregard for Washington's denunciations pleases Beijing."" There is also a practical reason for Beijing to refrain from endorsing Russia's military invasion: it might give foreign powers an excuse to intervene in China's own territories in the future. Beijing maintains a strong grip on its far-flung, ethnically diverse Xinjiang and Tibet regions. And the 2005 Anti-Secession Law permits the use of military force against Taiwan, should it declare independence through a referendum or some other official mechanism. ""China is highly ambivalent towards the referendum in Crimea as it is uneasy about the potential implications for its own territorial or ethnic minority issues,"" said Chengxin Pan , a fellow with Australian Institute of International Affairs. Sharing more than 4,000 kilometres of border with Russia, China is also worried about the risk of a wider Russian incursion as nationalistic leader Vladimir Putin pokes at Western weakness and tries to restore Moscow's influence over its old Soviet empire. Beijing has bitter memories of Soviet military action in smaller countries, such as Hungary in 1953 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, which enraged Mao Zedong enough to launch a campaign against ""social imperialism"". Russian forces helped push Chinese troops out of Mongolia beginning in 1920, and Ukraine's return to the Kremlin's orbit has echoes of ""Finlandisation"" during the cold war, when the Soviet Union influenced the Nordic country's polices."
"The U.S. should lead an international effort to address pressing global challenges using AI. This would go beyond overarching issues like ethics and governance that have been the focus of discussion in existing international forums, and put cooperation on AI into practice. This should seek to address transnational issues that demand public intervention at scale, such as health (e.g., disease migration) and climate change (e.g., climate modeling). Such leadership could begin in cooperation with the EU and other government) but should become part of broader U.S. diplomatic and development outreach and investment."
"The U.S. House passed a $12.3 billion water-projects bill that lawmakers said would boost dredging to accommodate larger ships built to transit the expanding Panama Canal. The measure, passed 412-4, would be the first water infrastructure bill enacted since 2007. It would authorize 34 projects including dredging, flood control, hurricane recovery and environmental restoration. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act, H.R. 3080, would revamp the way major U.S. shipping projects are funded. The bill would allow ports to pay the cost of deepening harbors up front and then seek reimbursement from the government once a project is authorized by lawmakers. That could help facilities such as Port Everglades in South Florida reduce construction time by years. “It is a jobs bill,” House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster told reporters. In addition to construction jobs, the Pennsylvania Republican said, “when America invests in its infrastructure and keeps us competitive, that means our industry and business can be competitive and add jobs on the factory floor.” The measure would expand the number of U.S. ports that can handle super freighters built by Maersk Inc. and Mediterranean Shipping Co. to take advantage of the expanding Panama Canal. Expanded capacity would reduce shipping costs for exporters including Caterpillar Inc. and Cargill Inc. ‘No’ Votes All four House lawmakers voting against the measure were Republicans: Justin Amash of Michigan, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and Matt Salmon of Arizona. The bill was the subject of a lobbying campaign that industry groups said they want to make a model for future infrastructure bills. Shipping industry groups targeted Tea Party lawmakers by stressing the role of interstate commerce in the Constitution, and emphasizing quotes from founding fathers such as George Washington backing the construction of canals. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has said the Senate will act on the compromise bill this week. By far the biggest spending project authorized in the measure is $6.7 billion for a Louisiana levee system called Morganza to the Gulf. Other flood-prevention projects in the bill are a diversion channel for the Red River of the North near Fargo, North Dakota, and Moorhead, Minnesota, as well as levees in the Natomas Basin in Sacramento, California. The largest navigation project would deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which connects the oil-refining hub of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, with the Gulf of Mexico. Keystone Pipeline The Port Arthur area is home to the southern end of the Keystone XL pipeline. Deepening the port would reduce shipping costs for oil and natural gas processed there by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Total SA and Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) Paul Beard, chairman of the Sabine Neches Navigation District, said he was “thrilled” by the project’s inclusion. The navigation district, which oversees the waterway on the Texas-Louisiana border, projects the channel deepening to boost business activity by $5 billion. The measure also would speed environmental reviews of infrastructure plans, capping review time at three years. Farm Bureau The American Farm Bureau Federation urged Congress to pass the bill. Farmers “depend on an efficient and reliable inland waterway system linked to competitive ports,” bureau President Bob Stallman said in a statement today. Environmental groups objected to the limit on review time, and the measure drew opposition from small-government groups including Heritage Action. “It hikes spending while doing little to reduce bureaucracy and limit the role of the federal government,” Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said in an e-mail urging lawmakers to vote against the bill. Shuster and House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said the measure was a success for those who want to trim government. The bill was crafted without earmarks to fund pet projects in lawmakers’ home states, they said. It also would delete $18 billion in backlogged projects that, while unlikely to get built, were still technically on government ledgers. It also would create a Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Authority, a federal-private financing program for water infrastructure. About $175 million in subsidies through 2019 may lead to $1.75 billion in projects, Bloomberg Industries analyst Brian Friel said. Project Financing JPMorgan Chase & Co. led U.S. project financing for the year to date, underwriting $89 billion in projects through May 20, according to a Bloomberg compilation of data. JPMorgan was followed by Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. The measure would encourage the use of U.S.-made iron and steel products that could increase demand for products manufactured by Nucor Corp. and United States Steel Corp., Bloomberg analysts Friel and Brad Barker said."
"Simply put, anyone convicted of a crime under a “mandatory minimum” gets at least that sentence. The goal of these laws when they were developed was to promote uniformity; it doesn’t matter how strict or lenient your judge is, as the law and the law alone determines the sentence you receive."
"With the Chinese dragon economy losing some of its fire as it slows at a faster-than-expected rate, some manufacturers are getting burned with labour disputes, unexpected shutdowns and massive layoffs as the declining manufacturing sector seriously disrupts their supply chains. North American enterprises consider reshoring in the wake of turmoil in the Chinese economy. The introduction of annual minimum wage increases – upping salaries 50% since 2011 – and the broad impact of rising Chinese labour rates is being felt in many industries, particularly electronics. Renewed emphasis on the enforcement of manufacturing regulations is also factoring into a climate that is less ‘business friendly’ than it once was, with the end result being an increasing number of manufacturers pulling up stakes and moving to other rapidly developing economies within Asia – or even reinvesting in North America. Nokia recently laid off 9,000 employees and shuttered factories in Beijing, Dongguan and Suzhou – where it has operated since 1998 – citing the need to maintain cost controls, and refocus on research and development. Some of its manufacturing is transferring to Vietnam. Foxconn – one of China’s largest exporters and manufacturer of iconic brands such as Apple’s iPhone – has announced a $5 billion investment in India to build 12 factories. Foxconn’s Chinese operations have been chronically plagued with labour shortages and unrest. Samsung is accelerating its pace of withdrawal from China, and shifting production facilities to Vietnam, with a new $2 billion plant opening in 2015, the construction of another $3 billion plant announced, and $12 billion in investments pledged Samsung cites lower wages and favourable tax incentives as prime motivators for the move. One of today’s greatest secrets is the fact that it’s just as cheap – if not cheaper – to manufacturer goods in North America, without the drama and turmoil. North American manufacturing offers a reliable, skilled workforce, highly regulated to the benefit of everyone involved, with a history of ethical treatment of employees, and competitive pricing when factoring in the total cost of production, sans customs, tariffs, duties, shipping time, and communication barriers. It’s something Panasonic clearly realized: Panasonic recently closed its Beijing-based lithium-ion battery factory – which had operated since 2000 – cutting 1,300 jobs, and citing the need to refocus on higher-margin products such as electric car batteries. Panasonic has committed to a multi-billion dollar investment in Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. The time is overdue for manufacturers to reassess the sometimes decades old ‘wisdom’ that North America can’t compete with China. The Chinese advantage is shrinking fast, and the default option that China is always cheaper should be treated with scepticism."
"Mimeticism here is no longer simply a literary convention, however. Rather, it is a type of representational copula-tion forced at the juncture between literature and ethnicity, a reflectionism that explicitly or implicitly establishes equivalence between a cultural practice and an ethnic label—in the form of ""this kind of poetic/narrative convention is Chinese."" In this equation —this act to validate a particular kind of writing as ethnic difference per se— mimeticism, chastised though it may be at the formal level as an evil Western tradition, returns with a vengeance as the stereotyped way to control and police the reception of literary writing. In the hands of the sinolo-gists, even ancient poems and narratives, it turns out, are documentaries—of what is Chinese. In the study of modern Chinese literature, such mi-meticism between writing and ethnicity, which has all along been foisted on Third World literature in general, would receive a different name—national allegory—soon to be adopted widely even among Chinese critics. Meanwhile, the émigrés who can no longer claim proprietorship to Chinese culture through residency in China henceforth inhabit the melan-choly position of an ethnic group that, as its identity is being ""authenticated"" abroad, is simultaneously relegated to the existence of ethnographic speci-mens under the Western gaze. Worth mentioning in this context is the work of Tsi-an Hsia, who, in the 1950s, attempted, in Taiwan, to reinvigo-rate Chinese writing by advocating, through borrowing the principles of the Anglo-American New Critics, serious attitudes toward ""new poetry?' One of the results of this attempt to rediscover the true poet's voice, however, was a further displacement of the ethnicity that such literary efforts were supposed to consolidate—the trend among Chinese students from Taiwan to study abroad in the United States, eventually bringing the habits of New Criticism to bear on their reading of Chinese literature overseas.32 As Gunn comments, ""It is tempting to conclude that T. A. Hsia and his students had not brought modern literature to Taiwan but had moved Chinese literature to the United States."" 33 In exile, Chinese writing (first in Taiwan, then in the United States) is condemned to nostalgia, often no sooner reflecting or recording the ""reality"" of Chinese life overseas than rendering Chineseness itself as something the essence of which belongs to a bygone era.34 Even so, the coerciveness of the typical mimeticism between representation and ethnicity continues.35 No matter how nonmimetic, experimental, subversive, or avant-garde such diasporic writing might try to be, it is invariably classified, marketed, and received in the West as Chinese, in a presupposed correspondence to that reality called China. As in the case of representations by all minorities in the West, a kind of paternalistic, if not downright racist, attitude persists as a method of categorizing minority discourse: Minorities are allowed the right to speak only on the implicit expectation that they speak in the documentary mode, ""reflecting"" the group from which they come."
"In other words, if a minimally basic education is a fundamental right of children in this country, how should the government secure that right for the people? This question facially conflicts with Justice Powell's opinion in Rodriguez that education is a local concern and too complex for the federal government to try to regulate. n118 However, if the federal government's responsibility is recognized (as it can be argued the Plyler Court emphasizes), n119 demonstrably unequal education pervading the country cannot be allowed. n120 While unequal education may be the result of numerous factors, such as segregation n121 or illegal alien status, n122 such inequality today usually concerns education spending."
"It is undoubtedly within the power of the Federal Government to exclude aliens from the country. Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U. S. 581, 603-604. It is also without doubt that this power can be effectuated by routine inspections and searches of individuals or conveyances seeking to cross our borders. As the Court stated in Carroll v. United States: ""Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in."" 267 U. S., at 154. See also Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.¶ Whatever the permissible scope of intrusiveness of a routine border search might be, searches of this kind may in certain circumstances take place not only at the border itself, but at its functional equivalents as well. For 273*273 example, searches at an established station near the border, at a point marking the confluence of two or more roads that extend from the border, might be functional equivalents of border searches. For another example, a search of the passengers and cargo of an airplane arriving at a St. Louis airport after a nonstop flight from Mexico City would clearly be the functional equivalent of a border search.[4]¶ But the search of the petitioner's automobile by a roving patrol, on a California road that lies at all points at least 20 miles north of the Mexican border,[5] was of a wholly different sort. In the absence of probable cause or consent, that search violated the petitioner's Fourth Amendment right to be free of ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""¶ It is not enough to argue, as does the Government, that the problem of deterring unlawful entry by aliens across long expanses of national boundaries is a serious one. The needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension with the Constitution's protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power. It is precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards. It 274*274 is well to recall the words of Mr. Justice Jackson, soon after his return from the Nuremberg Trials:¶ ""These [Fourth Amendment rights], I protest, are not mere second-class rights but belong in the catalog of indispensable freedoms. Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government."" Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 180 (Jackson, J., dissenting).¶ The Court that decided Carroll v. United States, supra, sat during a period in our history when the Nation was confronted with a law enforcement problem of no small magnitude—the enforcement of the Prohibition laws. But that Court resisted the pressure of official expedience against the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Chief Justice Taft's opinion for the Court distinguished between searches at the border and in the interior, and clearly controls the case at bar:¶ ""It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is 275*275 known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise."" 267 U. S., at 153-154.¶ Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is¶ Reversed."
"When state legislatures pass drug court acts or related legislation authorizing this noncarceral drug court approach, the effect is to bypass political barriers to more explicit decriminalization and to lend democratic legitimacy to drug courts’ efforts.227 Reentry courts may also operate on a decarceration model. Parole or probation violators constitute approximately 50–65% of people admitted to state prison, and about half of these individuals are re-incarcerated for technical violations.228 Reentry courts may facilitate access to social services and employment and rely on those referral sources for notification of extremely concerning noncompliance but otherwise sharply limit reincarceration for technical violations.229 Although most domestic violence courts function on a judicial monitoring model of limited effectiveness and with substantial associated rights-eviscerating risks, domestic violence courts could shift to a decarceration model for certain cases arising from relatively less serious and less violent incidents. Alternative sentences could still be onerous and require, among other conditions, considerable financial support of and physical separation from the complainant. These provisions might better serve the interests of the complainant spouse than incarceration for short periods of a spouse who is the primary source of financial support for the family.230 Courts could also work to facilitate services for complainants—as do many domestic violence courts currently— particularly because the availability of alternative living arrangements, employment opportunities, or vocational or educational training may empower survivors of domestic violence to leave or transform abusive relationships and, hence, in the long-run reduce reoffending, re-arrests, and reincarceration. Sex offense courts are generally conceptualized primarily on a judicial monitoring model but could also shift to a decarceration model by identifying those individuals whose convictions are such that carceral sentencing seems unnecessary (for instance, individuals convicted on the basis of public urination, certain other forms of indecent exposure, or consensual sex with a person not significantly younger than the accused).231 In all of these separate specialized criminal court contexts, a decarceration model does not purport to be capable of solving the underlying problems. Instead, a decarceration model frees up resources that might be allocated to sectors better able to address relevant problems, even if the problems ultimately remain in some measure intractable, at least without further-reaching intervention. A decarceration model is minimalist in its mission as compared to competing criminal law reformist models, at least with regard to the degree of intervention taking place in the court itself. Empirical monitoring may establish the basis for transferring this framework outside the specialized courts context, facilitating farther-reaching transformative criminal law reform. Gradually, in an incremental experimentalist fashion, a decarceration model may begin to reform criminal law more broadly by working to address the compound problem of the criminal law’s relationship to social-order maintenance and the social conditions associated with targeted conduct, moving the regulation of certain matters outside criminal law administration to other sectors. In summary, the upshot of the Article’s analysis to this point is that if specialized criminal courts aim to begin to reduce harshness and brutality in criminal law administration and to limit reliance on criminal supervision and incarceration while addressing socially disruptive conduct, they should organize themselves predominantly on a diversionary, minimalist, experimental, sociologically oriented decarceration model. The therapeutic, judicial monitoring, and order maintenance models represent distinct criminal law reformist strategies that threaten to exacerbate rather than unwind existing problems in criminal law administration because they each possess inherent features that tend to increase reliance on criminal supervision and that may even expand incarceration— radically transforming the judicial role and diluting procedural protections more significantly than on a decarceration model, without generating other demonstrated desirable outcomes. The following Part will explore in more detail three criminal law reform strategies that courts adopting a decarceration model may set in motion. Part IV will address anticipated objections."
"The prospect of a new nuclear arms race with the United States is dredging up old, cold war-era worries in the minds of many Russians. President Trump has vowed to upgrade the US nuclear arsenal and “outspend and out-innovate all others by far.” But it was Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that Russia will pursue a “symmetrical response” that has reminded many of the failures of the Soviet era."
"BEIJING--With progress slow toward a broad investment treaty with the U.S., senior Chinese officials are focusing on one area they hope could show a willingness to open China's markets: green finance. Liu He, top economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, is spearheading an effort to encourage U.S. companies to invest in energy-efficient projects in China, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Liu discussed the initiative during his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday, these people say, a day before the start of the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the world's two largest economies. The emphasis on a relatively low-profile sector comes as negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty that would give U.S. and Chinese companies better access to each other's markets crawl into their ninth year. Beijing's latest offer, delivered last year, still listed as many as 40 sectors that would be off limits to foreign investors. The U.S. has said that this ""negative list"" needs to be significantly whittled down. Mr. Lew indicated in Beijing that while talks go on over a broader treaty, access can be improved sector-by-sector. The green-finance initiative led by Mr. Liu includes a fund that would pool U.S. and Chinese capital to invest in environmentally friendly projects in China. Mr. Liu is director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, which acts somewhat like the White House's National Economic Council. The first round of investment in the fund is expected to be around 20 billion yuan ($3 billion). Chinese officials hope the fact that many of the planned projects will be government-supported will make the fund attractive to U.S. investors. Provinces including Zhejiang and Jiangsu in eastern China and Hebei in the north have signed on to offer projects to invest in, according to the officials. As for the broader treaty, Mr. Lew hopes the Obama administration can carry talks ""close to the finishing line"" in its remaining months in office, he said in a speech Sunday at Beijing's Tsinghua University. But in a recent report, David Dollar, a senior fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former Treasury attaché in Beijing, wrote that ""Chinese leaders will want to wait and see what administration they will be dealing with and to save deliverables for those future negotiations."" China's commerce ministry has been leading the effort on the negative list. But the process also involves many other ministries--in areas from security to education and culture--that have resisted opening up, Chinese officials say. The green-finance initiative comes as Beijing puts increasing emphasis on dealing with the country's enormous environmental issues . Rapid growth in recent decades, most powered by real estate, construction and smokestack industries, has resulted in not only rising debt but also polluted skies over much of the country. China faces a huge need for capital to clean up its environment, officials and analysts say. The People's Bank of China, which last year started making it easier for companies to sell bonds pay for energy-efficient projects, estimates environmental projects will require at least $320 billion a year over the next five years--and experts say the government's fiscal resources can cover no more than 15% of that. On Monday, Mr. Lew said a new global climate accord reached by the U.S., China and other countries will require ""the unprecedented levels of funding."" ""A variety of channels"" including new funds and direct bilateral assistance will be needed to meet those needs, he said."
"Ted Cruz made no mistake in highlighting his opposition to a set of educational standards known as Common Core in his first presidential campaign speech. ""Instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through Common Core,"" he said to applause from the Liberty University crowd on March 23, ""imagine repealing every word of Common Core."" Formally known as the Common Core State Standards, the once low-key, bipartisan effort to improve math and literacy education has quickly transformed into a major issue for many conservatives like Cruz, now a Republican U.S. senator from Texas, as they believe it's just another example of government overreach. It's also a way for Cruz and other politicians likely to vie for the Republican Party nomination—including Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker—to differentiate themselves from potential front-runner Jeb Bush. The former Florida governor is a long-time Common Core supporter, a topic detractors could seek to tie to his establishment credentials and political moderation. That combination of factors has virtually assured that Common Core will be an important topic of debate ahead of voting in November 2016. ""It will be a major issue because of its symbolic importance,"" said Tom Loveless, who researches education policy as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a politically centrist think tank. ""It's red meat for the kinds of conservative activists that a number of the contenders on the Republican side want to appeal to."" From bipartisan to blow up Until a few years ago, Common Core seemed like a benign push to make sure American public school students were competitive in English and math. Shaped by Democratic and Republican governors and education leaders, the benchmarks were adopted voluntarily in 45 states and the District of Columbia. But Common Core has fast become controversial. Conservatives pundits like Glenn Beck and Michelle Malkin helped spread the notion of a Washington takeover of schools after some federal funding was linked to Common Core. On the left, teachers unions that once backed Common Core expressed concerns on its recent rollout, worried that it added to overtesting of students and unfair evaluations of instructors. Primary action Attention to Common Core will be most visible during the presidential primaries, according to experts. The key to that is Bush, a longtime supporter of improving educational standards in his time as Florida governor from 1999 to 2007. As conservative opposition to Common Core has grown, Bush has been forced to defend his stance. ""Raising expectations and having accurate assessments of where kids are is essential for success, and I'm not going to back down on that,"" Bush said during a congressional fundraiser in Iowa in March, according to The Associated Press. That position has put him at odds with most other likely opponents. Take Jindal, the Louisiana governor, for example. After initially supporting the standards, Jindal sued the Obama administration in August over Common Core, claiming that the federal grants to states related to the Race to the Top program were unconstitutional because they forced states to adopt the standards. (Program grants were for general standards improvement, although much of the money distributed was related to Common Core.) Like Jindal, several other big names initially supported Common Core—or gave it tacit approval—but have now turned against the standards or backed away from them. Examples include Wisconsin Gov. Walker, New Jersey Gov. Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Besides Cruz, other likely candidates who are against Common Core include Kentucky Sen. Paul, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""They're all sort of moving away from it,"" said Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at libertarian think tank Cato Institute. ""I don't think you want to be called a flip-flopper, but even worse is to be associated with a policy that people really don't like."""
"The effect of deconstructing the power of the author to impose a fixed meaning on the text or offer a continuous narrative is both debilitating and liberating. It is debilitating in that any attempt to say what should be done within even our insular Foucaultian preoccupations may be oppositionalized and deconstructed as an illegitimate privileging of one term, value, perspective or narrative over another. The struggle over meaning might continue ad infinitum. That is, if a deconstructionist is theoretically consistent and sees deconstruction not as a political tool but as a philosophical orientation, political action is impossible, because such action requires a degree of closure that deconstruction, as a theoretical matter, does not permit. Moreover, the approach is debilitating because deconstruction without material rootedness, without goals and vision, creates a political and spiritual void into which the socially real power we theoretically deconstruct steps and steps on the disempowered and dispossessed.  [*762]  To those dying from AIDS, stifled by poverty, dehumanized by sexism and racism, crippled by drugs and brutalized by the many forms of physical, political and economic violence that characterizes our narcissistic culture, power hardly seems a matter of illegitimate theoretical privileging. When vision, social theory and political struggle do not accompany critique, the void will be filled by the rich, the powerful and the charismatic, those who influence us through their eloquence, prestige, wealth and power."
"In some ways, the concept of inequality is unhelpful here. There has rarely been a political or business leader who has stood up and publicly said, “society needs more inequality”. And yet, most of the policies and regulations which have driven inequality since the 1970s have been publicly known. Although it is tempting to look back and feel duped by the pre-2008 era, it was relatively clear what was going on, and how it was being justified. But rather than speak in terms of generating more inequality, policy-makers have always favoured another term, which effectively comes to the same thing: competitiveness. My new book, The Limits of Neoliberalism: Sovereignty, Authority & The Logic of Competition, is an attempt to understand the ways in which political authority has been reconfigured in terms of the promotion of competitiveness. Competitiveness is an interesting concept, and an interesting principle on which to base social and economic institutions. When we view situations as ‘competitions’, we are assuming that participants have some vaguely equal opportunity at the outset. But we are also assuming that they are striving for maximum inequality at the conclusion. To demand ‘competitiveness’ is to demand that people prove themselves relative to one other. It struck me, when I began my Sociology PhD on which the book is based, that competitiveness had become one of the great unquestioned virtues of contemporary culture, especially in the UK. We celebrate London because it is a competitive world city; we worship sportsmen for having won; we turn on our televisions and watch contestants competitively cooking against each other. In TV shows such as the Dragons Den or sporting contests such as the Premier League, the division between competitive entertainment and capitalism dissolves altogether. Why would it be remotely surprising, to discover that a society in which competitiveness was a supreme moral and cultural virtue, should also be one which generates increasing levels of inequality? Unless one wants to descend into biological reductionism, the question then has to be posed: how did this state of affairs come about? To answer this, we need to turn firstly to the roots of neoliberal thinking in the 1930s. For Friedrich Hayek in London, the ordoliberals in Freiburg and Henry Simons in Chicago, competition wasn’t just one feature of a market amongst many. It was the fundamental reason why markets were politically desirable, because it conserved the uncertainty of the future. What united all forms of totalitarianism and planning, according to Hayek, was that they refused to tolerate competition. And hence a neoliberal state would be defined first and foremost as one which used its sovereign powers to defend competitive processes, using anti-trust law and other instruments."
"WHY THE STATES MATTER -- States have earned their reputations as laboratories for a reason. With greater discretion over their budgets, wide latitude in acting on health care and education, and a proximity to constituents that makes reform easier than it is in the insulated Beltway, state legislators are well positioned to institute policies to make a difference in people's lives. Consider this: State and local revenue is equal to 16.2 percent of GDP. State courts handle 17 million civil cases a year. State employment law lays the baseline of worker rights for millions of Americans. States house 1.9 million prisoners, more than ten times the prison population at the federal level. And state publicemployee pensions manage trillions in assets. While the federal government dedicates billions to health care and education programs, the way the money is spent is often determined not in Congress, but in state legislatures. In other words, whether the issue is criminal law, tort law, workplace issues, classrooms or health care, states are the critical battlegrounds. And with a handful of Northeastern states and California embracing real global-warming reforms, these local moves are pushing the issue along at the national level. A hike in the minimum wage -- now one of the highest priority issues for the new Congress -- gained steam after being pushed through legislature after legislature last session and getting a mandate from voters in six states who approved cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. With D.C. talking about fixing Medicare Part D, a number of states have already made bold moves with prescription drugs, including innovative cost-savings measures in Oregon, Maine and elsewhere that have served to remind voters and the press that Americans don't have to settle for legislation written by pharmaceutical lobbyists during a time of record industry profits. States don't just produce leading issues; they also produce leaders. In 2006, a number of the most inspiring and successful candidates for U.S. Senate -- Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester, Amy Klobuchar, and Claire McCaskill -- cut their teeth in state and local government. In the next two years, states will have an opportunity to continue their leadership, and in more states than ever, progressives will be poised at the fore. Make no mistake, corporate America understands the power of statehouses. While Washington lobbyists have reined supreme for the last twelve years, BusinessWeek has reported that lobbyists are setting their sights on the statehouses as a result of the newly hostile landscape in Washington. If progressives are going to prevent November's gains from being anything but Pyrrhic victories, it is incumbent upon us to be ready to take key policy fights to the states. PROGRESSIVE STRENGTH IN THE STATES -- Prior to the 2006 election, Democrats controlled the â€œtrifectaâ€? -- both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office -- in eight states. That number has since risen to fifteen. But the numbers are slightly misleading: Some of these states are very narrowly held or are effectively in the control of conservative Democrats. But these numbers also understate progressive performance in key ways. In Washington and Colorado, Democratic majorities previously held hostage by one or two conservative members swelled in size, with the November vote, improving their ability to move legislation. In California, Governor Arn..old Schwarzenegger, although less than perfect, has shown a willingness to cooperate on some key progressive issues. In Minnesota, the Democratic gains in the legislature were very significant, increasing the likelihood that progressives will be able to override vetoes from the conservative governor. In New York, the Working Families Party, through its cross-endorsement strategy, has fostered key relationships with Republicans in the GOP-held Senate. In virtually every state in the nation, progressives enter the 2007 legislative cycle in a better position than they did two years ago. That means that they can pass more good bills and defeat more bad ones than has been possible for a very long time. Fortunately, progressives also have an agenda to put in place in the states. A WINNING AGENDA -- The minimum wage won big in every state where it was on the ballot. America wants a raise. But the minimum wage is just a beginning. A real progressive agenda will increase democracy, strengthen communities and families, ensure that work is rewarded, and find new economic-growth strategies. By cutting across single-issue divides, a progressive agenda can inspire the country and unite people who would not otherwise find common ground."
"Determining whether the system is now safer requires looking at three different dimensions of the question. The first involves trying to assess the underlying fragility of the system today. How much dry tinder, so to speak, is there in terms of short-term liabilities, and how much privately owned capital is available to absorb losses in an economic downturn? The second involves the ability to limit the intensity of a crisis. How much fiscal capacity does the government have to cushion a fall in private demand, and how much monetary scope does the Federal Reserve have to lower interest rates? The third dimension has to do with the other powers necessary to prevent a financial crisis from spiraling out of control. What emergency firefighting tools can policymakers use in the midst of a crisis?"
"But a new study by RTI International suggests that STEM isn’t for everyone. While nearly a quarter of high performing students who began pursuing a bachelor's degree between 2003 and 2009 declared a STEM major, nearly a third of these students had transferred out of STEM fields by spring 2009.¶ Right off, the study raises a lot of questions.¶ ""In light of the nation's need to build a strong STEM workforce to compete in the global economy, it is important to understand why college students are leaving STEM majors,"" said Xianglei Chen, research education analyst at RTI. ""Our results indicate that students' intensity of STEM coursework in the first year and their performance in STEM courses may have played an important role in their decision to switch majors.""¶ The study looked at the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study and tracked freshman bachelor's degree students over 6 years, focusing on STEM attrition among a group of high-performing college students.¶ By “high-performing,” the authors mean hard-working college students who demonstrate consistent, high-level performance during their 6-year college enrollment – prime candidates for STEM-related career fields.¶ The research team also used grade information to look at the STEM courses taken and how students performed in those courses, searching for any link with students leaving STEM majors.¶ Dropping out¶ What they found first was that low-performing students in STEM fields left the curriculum because they dropped out of college. It raises the question, without providing the answer, whether these students might have continued their education had they been in a less-challenging field of study.¶ Second, the study found that the high-performing students who quit STEM did so largely by switching to another major."
"Tens of millions of new jobs can be created around the world in the next two decades if green policies are put in place to switch the high-carbon economy to low-carbon, the UN has said. Between 15 million and 60 million additional jobs are likely, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). These are net gains in employment for the world economy, taking into account any job losses in high-carbon industries that fail to transform. Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP, said: ""The findings underline that [the green economy] can include millions more people in terms of overcoming poverty and delivering improved livelihoods for this and future generations. It is a positive message of opportunity in a troubled world of challenges."" As well as generating net new gains in the number of jobs, the switch to a green economy could help to lift millions of people out of poverty. In the US, there are now about three million green jobs, in sectors such as wind power and energy efficiency, the study found. In the UK, the number is close to one million and has been one of the few areas of the economy that has been creating jobs. There are about 500,000 people working in green jobs in Spain. In the developing world, too, the number is growing rapidly—about 7 percent of people employed in Brazil, amounting to three million people, are now in the green economy. However, realizing the full potential of green jobs depends on countries taking action to develop the green economy and bringing in policies that will foster investment, according to the report. Juan Somavia, director general of the International Labour Organisation, which was co-author of the report, said: ""The current development model has proven to be inefficient and unsustainable, not only for the environment, but for economies and societies as well. We urgently need to move to a sustainable development path with a coherent set of policies, with people and the planet at the center."" He rebuffed claims that greening industry would lead to job losses, because of the changes to some traditional industries such as fossil fuel extraction. He said: ""Environmental sustainability is not a job killer, as it is sometimes claimed. On the contrary, if properly managed, it can lead to more and better jobs, poverty reduction and social inclusion. Some areas are more vulnerable to losses—global fishing fleets, for instance, will probably have to be reduced if overfishing is to be tackled, and fishermen will have to be found new employment. But the report found that long-term sustainable management could avoid job losses. For instance, an estimated one million people in Asia may have lost jobs in forestry because of poor resource management, which could have been largely avoided with better policies and enforcement. Jobs easily identified as ""green""—workers in renewable energy, for instance, maintaining forests or installing insulation—are not the only ones to be touched by the shift to a more environmentally sustainable economy. At least half of the global workforce will be affected in some way by 2030, the study found. This will stretch from people whose industrial processes are overhauled to cut greenhouse gases, to farmers who change their methods to be more environmentally friendly, and workers in the construction industry who begin to install new greener materials. Some of the sectors identified in the report as being most affected by the changes include agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource-intensive manufacturing, recycling, building and transport. Women could benefit—if the shift is managed properly it could provide them with better access to jobs and higher incomes. The study, ""Working Towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for Decent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy,"" has been timed to be published ahead of World Environment Day next week, and to inform discussions at the landmark Rio+20 environmental conference, where nations will attempt to work on a new set of targets and agreements to help halt environmental degradation around the world."
"The theme for this year's conference is ""Innovation driving Blue Growth"". Innovation and research in the maritime economy can drive a European growth and jobs recovery whilst securing a sustainable future for Europe's seas, oceans, and all those whose livelihoods depend on them. That is the focus of this year's European Maritime Day held in Bremen, Germany, on 19-20 May which will host an exchange of ideas between experts, stakeholders from all maritime sectors and policy makers from across the EU. Commissioner Damanaki as co-host of the event, stated ahead of this year's European Maritime Day: ""Europe's economy is still in choppy waters and we have a duty to maximise every drop of potential to help its recovery. Our seas and oceans have this potential in abundance. We are committed to exploring how best they can help us create jobs and growth – but in a way that does not compromise on our ecosystems. The European Maritime Day is an occasion for the maritime community to discuss how to make sure that growth and sustainability go hand in hand in the blue economy"". The European Commission's Blue Growth agenda seeks to make sustainability the cornerstone for maritime growth, and will therefore be at the heart of the discussions in Bremen. Set against a backdrop of recent announcements by the EU on Blue Innovation, Maritime Spatial Planning, Coastal and Maritime tourism and Ocean energy, the event will bring together each sector of the maritime economy to discuss how they can co-operate, share insights, and make sustainable growth a reality."
"Of course, humans seize every opportunity to claim special moral qualities, placing themselves above brutal nature and the “beasts that populate it. Yet while it is no great intellectual triumph for humans to establish their primacy over nature—they have done so for millennia—the real question turns on the exact character that primacy assumes as it is historically played out. In the present context, “dominion” (as spelled out in Genesis and other texts) has meant exploitation and abuse, that is, domination largely bereft if positive ethical content – although some recent works (for example Matthew Scully’s Dominion) have sought to ground a defense of animal rights in religion. A different kind of human obligation would point in the direction of stewardship, calling attention to equity, balance, ecological sustainability, and coexistence between humans and the natural world. So far, however, human beings have done little to distance themselves from a brutal or Hobbesian state of nature having repeatedly proven themselves the most destructive and murderous of all creatures. The view of natural relations adopted here derives from Regan’s philosophical work – namely that all sentient being has inalienable rights to be free of pain and suffering at the hands of humans. For Regan, this line of thinking holds to several interrelated premises: (1) no moral justification exists for overriding animal interests in order to serve “higher interests”; (2) what matters is not specific intellectual or communication skills but rather the capacity to experience pain, suffering and loss; (3) while much of nature is inescapably used by humans as resources to satisfy material and other needs, this logic should not extend to other sentient beings; (4) humans ought to be stewards of nature and other species within it to the extent possible; and (5) human and animal interests are closely bound together within the same social and historical processes."
"Dumping this amount of cash on the economy will raise GDP growth for the short term, but also invite an earlier return of inflation and higher interest rates. For years, analysts searched the horizon for causes of the next recession and found none. Now we have an obvious one, a US growth spurt that sparks inflation and leads to another Fed induced series of interest rate spikes. This could be a 3-4 year time horizon. The bond markets are telling us as much, with ten year Treasury bond yields (TNX) rocketing an eye popping 17 basis points today, smashing through 2.02%. What this brings us is a higher high in stock prices, followed by another crash a few years down the road. This is simply the boom and bust cycle that has been a hallmark of capitalism since time immemorial."
"It is worth pausing to consider the potential net-widening or punishment-enhancing effect of informed misdemeanor sentencing. Net-widening, as well as class and race biases, are continuing critiques of the problem-solving court movement. 168 Net-widening occurs when law enforcement and prosecutors bring more individuals into the criminal justice system on the belief that the system can help them; net-widening also occurs when individuals who would otherwise be in the system but would suffer minimal punishment in a traditional courtroom are brought [*208] into a treatment court that imposes more onerous conditions before termination of the sentence (this has also been seen as punishment-enhancing). 169 There is a danger that informed misdemeanor sentencing can lead to net widening or punishment-enhancing simply because the judge has more information under such an approach than under current approaches to misdemeanor sentencing."
"Much has been made of U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to support India's push for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which was offered during his November trip to India, but the real story from his visit was its implications for bilateral military trade. During the trip, Obama announced that the United States would sell $5 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to India, including ten Boeing C-17 military transport aircraft and 100 General Electric F-414 fighter aircraft. Although the details are still being worked out, these and other contracts already in the works will propel the United States into the ranks of India's top three military suppliers, alongside Russia and Israel. With India planning to buy $100 billion worth of new weapons over the next ten years, arms sales may be the best way for the United States to revive stagnating U.S.-Indian relations. Even as nonmilitary trade and investment and social and cultural ties between India and the United States have advanced in recent years, Washington remains of two minds about its relationship with New Delhi. In 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush granted India an unprecedented nuclear deal, offering to assist India's civilian nuclear program in contravention of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The nuclear deal convinced many Indians that the United States could be a viable long-term partner. Bush's adamant resistance to Chinese and international nonproliferation advocates' pressure to abandon the deal cemented his status in India, as did his rebuffs of Pakistani demands for similar treatment."
"With all of the benefits and risks associated with nanotechnology most people don't seem too concerned about it. A recent study conducted by the National Science Foundation discovered that more than 67 percent of the people who responded to a survey expressed positive views of nanotechnology and said it would be likely to improve their lives, particularly in the medical arena. About 37 percent said the main risks were unexpected consequences and harmful side effects. Another 13 percent said it was weaponization and 9 percent thought medical and environmental contamination were the main risks. At 5 percent or less people felt privacy, expense and product failure concerns were risk factors. When it came to regulation about 50 percent said government regulation is necessary to address safety concerns. The researchers recruited and surveyed a panel of 76 adults over the course of 32 months. These individuals included community opinion leaders, environmental stakeholders, members of various church groups and other citizens. In addition to completing multiple surveys over time, the panelists also took part in structured interviews with open-ended questions on nanotechnology."
"Just a few years ago, Lockheed Martin was working to build a pilot plant to demonstrate a renewable energy technology called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) near the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The company wanted to get funding from the U.S. Navy for the pioneering project and to cable the electricity it produced straight to the naval base at Pearl Harbor.¶ Now Lockheed is designing that 10-megawatt pilot plant—but not in American waters. Instead, the facility will be off the coast of southern China, and Lockheed’s customer is a private Chinese company that develops resorts and luxury housing.¶ Over the years Lockheed has approached various potential partners, says Rob Varley, the company’s OTEC project manager. Building an offshore energy station at commercial scale is an expensive proposition, particularly when it’s the first time the technology is being tried out. Lockheed won’t release the cost of the project, but outside experts estimate that a 10-MW facility would cost roughly US $300 million to $500 million. However, experts say that a full-scale 100-MW plant would be more competitive at just $1.2 billion.¶ “The biggest challenge has been to get the gold and start the project,” says Varley, but in terms of engineering, he says, “I don’t see any showstoppers at this point.”¶ That’s not surprising, since the company has been working on OTEC since the 1970s, and the technology hasn’t changed drastically since then. OTEC systems make use of the temperature differential in tropical areas between warm surface water and cold deep water. In most systems, ammonia, which has a very low boiling point, passes through a heat exchanger containing the warm water. The ammonia is vaporized and used to turn a turbine, and then it’s cycled past the cold water to recondense. This is a renewable energy technology with the rare capacity to supply base-load power, as water temperatures are fairly stable.¶ The ammonia passes through a closed loop, while the water comes and goes through massive pipes. The project in China may pump cold water up from a depth of about 1000 meters, using a pipe that’s 4 meters across. Varley says that some of the infrastructure can be borrowed from the offshore drilling industry: “We showed them our requirements for the platform, and they yawned and said, ‘Is that all you got?’ ” he says. “But then we showed them the pipe.” Attaching the massive pipe to a relatively small floating platform creates unusual stresses, Varley says. Lockheed also had to find materials for the pipes and the heat exchangers that could withstand the harsh marine environment.¶ Lockheed’s client is Reignwood Group, a Chinese company whose diverse portfolio includes resort and housing developments. According to a company press release, Reignwood Group wants the 10-MW plant to supply all the power for a large-scale environmentally sound resort community that the company will build in southern China. A Reignwood spokesperson did not respond to requests for more details by press time. A Lockheed spokesperson says the companies are currently working on site selection and that they’ll start designing a facility this year to suit the specific conditions at that site.¶ The China project isn’t the only OTEC project going ahead. Baltimore-basedOTEC International is negotiating the terms of a 1-MW demonstration plant in Hawaii, and the company is planning much bigger facilities in Hawaii and the Caribbean. Both OTEC International and Lockheed Martin see their current plans as steps toward a much more ambitious goal: utility-scale OTEC plants. “Going from a PowerPoint to a 100-MW would be too big a leap,” says Lockheed’s Varley. OTEC advocates have been trying to build megawatt-scale facilities for decades, but several ambitious projects have failed to materialize. So why should it be different this decade? Eileen O’Rourke, president of OTEC International, says there’s a convergence of favorable conditions. “Island jurisdictions like Hawaii have very high energy prices and limited alternatives for base-load power, and OTEC fits with their desire to be energy independent and green,” she says. Add in mature technology from the offshore oil industry, she says, and “we just think the time is right for OTEC.”"
"Are Native calls for Black solidarity simply expedient in a situation of settler colonialism? My sense is that there is something more complicated, and concerning, at work. If one surveys the writing on Black-Native solidarity in the field of Native studies, one finds frequent reference to histories of shared struggle, strategic alliance, and cohabitation in place of or alongside acknowledgment of histories of Indian slavery, ongoing exclusion of Black Native people, and pervasive anti-Black racism. In drawing up the historical balance sheet this way, scholars suggest there is ground for Black-Native solidarity in the present. Even where there is no denial or minimization of the history of Indian slavery, even where Native anti-Black racism is recognized and the struggles of Black Native people are affirmed, an argument is forwarded that solidarity in this moment can be retrieved from the past and refashioned for the future. In this sense, Native peoples are seeking to reunite with lost allies, namely, those enslaved Africans from the early colonial period who demonstrated “a spiritual worldview, land-informed practices, and were held together by kinship structures which created relationships that allocated every one a role in the community” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). This is political solidarity derived from “cultural similarities.” The implications of this claim are considerable. If Black-Native solidarity is founded upon shared Indigenous worldviews, practices, and kinship structures, then the prerequisite for Black people to move, politically and ethically, from settlers to allies “in the interest of a deeper solidarity” with Native people is, in a word, re-indigenization. In so doing, Black people on the North American scene not only become politically relevant to settler decolonization but also, en route, redress “the true horror of slavery”— the loss of culture: “Diasporic Black struggles, with some exceptions, do not tend to lament the loss of Indigeneity and the trauma of being ripped away from the land that defines their very identities. From Indigenous perspectives, the true horror of slavery was that it has created generations of ‘de-culturalized’ Africans, denied knowledge of language, clan, family, and land base, denied even knowledge of who their nations are” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). From Indigenous perspectives, diasporic Black struggles would, first and foremost, need to lament the loss of indigeneity that slavery entails, a process that requires acknowledging that the loss is both historic and ongoing. This would be a more proper posttraumatic response than “internalizing colonial concepts of how peoples relate to land, resources, and wealth” (Amadahy and Lawrence 2009, 127). However, what becomes curious upon even the briefest reflection is the fact that “denied knowledge of language, clan, family, and land base”— and the consequent temptation toward “internalizing colonial concepts”—is precisely what Native re sis tance and resurgence is struggling against to this day. To wit: “I believe that the systematic disconnection (and dispossession) of Indigenous Peoples from our homelands is the defining characteristic of colonization” (Waziyatawin 2012, 72). So, deculturalization, or loss of indigeneity, is a general condition of Black and Native peoples, not one that Native people can restrict to Black people in order to offer (or withhold) sympathies. The structuring difference between settler colonization and enslavement is to be found precisely in the latter’s denial of “knowledge of who their nations are”— that is, deracination. On this count, the loss of indigeneity for Native peoples can be named and its recovery pursued, and that pursuit can (and must) become central to political mobilization. The loss of indigeneity for Black peoples can be acknowledged only abstractly and its recovery is lost to history, and so something else must (and can) become central to political mobilization. Not the dialectics of loss and recovery but rather the loss of the dialectics of loss and recovery as such, a politics with no (final) recourse to foundations of any sort, a politics forged from critical resources immanent to the situation, resources from anywhere and anyone, which is to say from nowhere and no one in particular. From Indigenous perspectives, this baseless politics can only ever be a liability. Without a base, which is to say a land base, a politics of resistance can only succumb to “civilization’s fallacies and destructive habits.” The quest for equality is perhaps the most pernicious of those fallacies. The conclusion of this line of thinking is that, due to “the trauma of being ripped away from the land that defines their very identities,” landless Black people in diaspora cannot mount genuine resistance to the settler colonial state and society; they can only be held apart from it as slaves. Which is to say that, without the benefits of a land base and absent the constitutive exclusion of slavery, Blacks are destined to become white, and thus settlers, in thought and action; moreover, they have effectively become so postemancipation.10 But rather than argue that Black people in North America do, in fact, have significant, if attenuated, Indigenous worldviews, practices, and kinship structures or, in any case, can learn such from others in order to begin fighting the good fight; I submit we must consider the possibility that (1) the “Black Diasporic struggles” under examination are irreducible to antiracism, (2) that antiracism is irreducible to demands upon the state, and (3) that demands upon the state are irreducible to statist politics.11 Blacks need not be Indigenous or enslaved Africans, or a mix of the two, in order to be allies to Native peoples in the Amer i cas, what ever that might mean. And I say all of this without a need to mention the “notable exceptions” other wise known as the Black radical tradition.12 What if there are, and will have always been, ways to pursue settler decolonization other wise than as Indigenous peoples and their immigrant allies, a movement from within slavery whose abolition is yet to come?"
"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that President Trump's top White House aides are getting along fine with each other, and disputed media reports about infighting and tension among officials. ""There is no palace intrigue, divisions, between the principals,"" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters. ""We talk constantly, our teams are working together. So there really is no schism whatsoever. Of course you are going to have this chattering class and that just kinds of happens in this day and age."" Ryan said talk to the contrary ""isn't true and isn't intimidating to us in any way whatsoever."" Ryan said Trump is helping to build support for the GOP proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare, which so far lacks enough backing to pass the House or Senate. He said he speaks nearly every day to Trump and shrugged off Trump's Twitter habit. He pointed to Trump's Wednesday rally in Tennessee promoting the GOP's healthcare reform agenda. Trump's support of the plan will unify Republicans behind it, Ryan said."
"A sweeping revision of state highway plans adds nearly $9 billion in new funds for improving Texas roadways, including a $1.32 billion infusion in the Houston area for a major overhaul of Interstate 45 and nine other projects. Projects along Texas 36 in Fort Bend and Brazoria counties and Texas 105 in Montgomery and San Jacinto counties were also included in the unified transportation plan approved Tuesday in Austin by the Texas Transportation Commission. ""This is a major step forward,"" said Commissioner Bruce Bugg. The newly approved plan adds 230 projects and $8.9 billion in funding statewide. The plan - updated annually in phases - guides all state highway, maritime and aviation spending. Projects across the state show up first in the plan, with the money for them tied to upcoming fiscal years for the Texas Department of Transportation. All the projects are dwarfed by the I-45 project. Last month, officials called it the type of project that comes around once every 50 years. ""We are trying to make long-term improvements, and we believe we've made them,"" said Quincy Allen, TxDOT Houston district director. Construction set to begin In the Houston area, the updated plan marks a massive increase in highway investment, primarily through a windfall of money from two voter-approved highway spending proposals in 2014 and 2015 that accelerated the redesign of Interstate 45 through Houston's central business district. ""Houston's problems are in the downtown area first and foremost,"" said Lauren Garduno, TxDOT's director of project and planning and development. Construction is expected to start in late 2020 on the first of seven separate projects that will realign I-45 along downtown's eastern side, parallel to Interstate 69, also known as U.S. 59 in the Houston area. Typically, construction begins about three to four months after bids are opened. If that timing holds, two months after I-45 work moves south, drivers frustrated on their way to Austin when westbound Interstate 10 drops to two lanes in Brookshire will start seeing orange cones. Crews will widen the freeway to three lanes in each direction to the Brazos River. Just before or after the holiday season, work will begin on a third project to reconstruct some of the connections where I-69 crosses Loop 610 near Uptown, as well as rebuild Loop 610 through the intersection.TxDOT expects all of the projects to finish in 2021, around the time downtown interchanges will start to see significant construction. Funding uncertain As they cheered the upcoming investments, state transportation officials also sounded a note of caution. While the commission can program money, they do so with what state budget writers — members of the Legislature — provide in upcoming budgets. Some state lawmakers have already discussed holding back on some of the spending related to Proposition 1, which voters approved in 2014, directing money from the state's so-called rainy day fund. Uncertainty also clouds federal money, another major source of how Texas widens roads, said transportation Commissioner Jeff Austin. Transportation commissioner Victor Vandergriff urged officials to keep in mind it will take many decisions in Austin and potentially in local communities to keep many projects moving toward construction, and not all of them will make it. The facts are there are never enough dollars out there for every project and we are going to be limited at the state level with what we can do,"" Vandergriff said, noting a host of funding alternatives and considerations about how to expand roads.n ""We know we are going to have to address that,"" he said. ""Not us, the state of Texas."""
"The results of the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment¶ ¶ (MEA), as well as other global and regional assessments of the¶ ¶ marine environment, recognize that biodiversity in the world’s oceans and coastal areas continue to decline. Last year, a group of leading scientists concluded in Science that, ‘‘the loss of marine biodiversity is increasingly impairing the ocean’s ability to produce seafood, resist diseases, ﬁlter pollutants, maintain water quality and recover from perturbations such as over-ﬁshing and climate change’’¶ ¶ [6]. The MEA recognizes that people are at the center of this evolution. Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period in human history [7].¶ ¶ Rapid population growth, technological change and improvement, and growing consumer demands, have all considerably¶ ¶ increased the need for more food, more energy and more trade.¶ ¶ Because of limited or diminishing resources on land, an increasing larger share of goods and services needs to come from coastal and marine areas. Resource extraction is expanding progressively into¶ ¶ deeper waters and further offshore [8]. Aquaculture, offshore¶ ¶ energy, maritime transport and tourism are all facing increasingly¶ ¶ ﬂourishing and prosperous times in coming years. Future outlooks for offshore activities conﬁrm that this trend will continue, and¶ ¶ even more likely accelerate, in the next decades.1¶ ¶ All these activities have already considerably increased the demand for ocean space, and will continue to do so in the future.¶ ¶ In some parts of the world, combined demands for human use of ocean space have exceeded about three times the available space [9,10]. Because of overlapping objectives, not all uses are compatible with one another and are competing for ocean space or have adverse effects on each other (user– user conﬂicts, e.g., oil and gas development and ﬁsheries) [11]. A comprehensive study on the¶ ¶ interactions among users completed for the Belgian Part of the¶ ¶ North Sea classiﬁed conﬂicts among users from ‘‘manageable in¶ ¶ time, space and overlap’’ to ‘‘mutual exclusion.’’ A visualization of¶ ¶ this user–user interaction shows clearly that conﬂicts or negative¶ ¶ impacts among users far outreach their positive interactions¶ ¶ (Fig. 1) [12].¶ ¶ However, conﬂicts among users and the development of¶ ¶ offshore economic activities are not the only pressing issue in¶ ¶ the oceans. The biggest concern today is the impact of all these activities on the marine environment or, in other words, the conﬂicts between human use and the marine environment (user– environment conﬂicts). With resources being limited both in space and amount, economic development has proven to be devastating for many places and resources, elevating competition¶ ¶ among users and interest groups and resulting in increasingly¶ ¶ undesirable effects, including over-ﬁshing, loss and destruction of habitat, pollution, climate change, and the cumulative threats to the health of the oceans as a whole.¶ ¶ Also, irrespective of the existence of conﬂicts and human¶ ¶ impacts, marine ecosystems have an inherent need to function¶ ¶ sustainably. The same can be said from an economic perspective.¶ ¶ Offshore economic sectors, to continue their existence and remain¶ ¶ economically viable, have to develop and function sustainably¶ ¶ as well.¶ ¶ The multiple objectives related to achieving economic and environmental sustainability, and the need to minimize and reduce conﬂicts of both types (user– user and user– environment¶ ¶ conﬂicts) can only be dealt with through an integrated approach to management. This is nothing new. In the late 1930s, an¶ ¶ integrated, multiple objective approach was ﬁrst introduced in¶ ¶ water resource management in the United States. Highly inﬂuenced by system analysis concepts (management of complex¶ systems, e.g., the lunar landing program) of the late 1950s and the¶ environmental movements of the 1960s and early 1970s, it was¶ further deepened in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone¶ Management (ICZM, or alternatively Integrated Coastal and Marine¶ Area Management (IMCAM)) during the 1980s–1990s. Since the¶ late 1970s, the scientiﬁc community has increasingly drawn the¶ attention to the problems in the oceans—from biodiversity losses¶ and transformed food webs to marine pollution and warming¶ waters—and has sought for ways to preserve certain areas for¶ their ecological value.2 Especially during the last decade, many of¶ these evolving trends and disciplines have merged together,¶ evoking a new paradigm shift toward an ecosystem-based approach to sea use management, built on the recognition that ‘‘the nature of nature itself is integrated [13].’’¶ Many scientists have advocated reforms centered on the idea¶ of ecosystem-based, sea use management. To date, however, a¶ feasible method for translating this attractive concept into¶ operational management practice has not emerged [4]. Concepts¶ regarding both integrated and ecosystem-based management¶ are often too broad, too abstract and too complex for resource¶ managers to enable effective implementation [14]. One way to achieve a better and more effective implementation of ecosystem-based management in the marine environment is through the use of MSP."
"The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all facing increased difficulties attracting servicemembers, but shifting US immigration policies may make the military a less appealing option for some of the most sought-after recruits. ""At the end of the day, people are what makes everything work, and we really have to focus on this. Going forward we're all going to have a real war for talent,"" Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer said Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sitting alongside Army Secretary Mark Esper and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. ""The three of us up here fish from the same pool, and we're all going to be looking for more people to do more things in a more intelligent manner,"" Spencer said. Senior military officials have emphasized increased recruiting and growing the size of their forces as key components of improving readiness. Wilson said in September that the Air Force was ""too small for what's being asked of us."" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said in October that he had believed for ""quite some time"" that the Army needed to add more soldiers. ""We need to grow in order to meet the demands that the nation expects at the readiness levels it expects,"" Milley said. Recruiting has been a stumbling block for the armed services. Last year, the Army — which is seeking 80,000 troops in 2018, 11,000 more than were sought in 2017 — started accepting less-qualified troops, offering heftier bonuses, and granting more waivers for previously disqualifying things, like marijuana use and, in some cases, histories of mental illness. The Army was adamant that it was not lowering its standards — rather it was changing the level of authority at which decisions about waivers for some standards were being made. Recruiting efforts have also been complicated by a robust US economy. While the Pentagon has met its recruiting targets in recent years, low unemployment rates, common during the past few years, are seen as a hindrance. ""When the unemployment rate goes down — as it has been — military enlistment goes down as well,"" Beth Asch, a military-manpower researcher at Rand Corp, told Bloomberg. ""There's a positive relationship."""
"The basic political context for the discussion about white working class voters is the urgent challenge of the 2018 and 2020 elections. These elections will determine whether the horrendous outcome of the 2016 elections represented a wake-up call for progressives, or a nightmare that has only just begun. If Democrats do not make significant gains in the states in these two elections, Republicans will dominate another decennial round of redistricting that could place not only state legislatures but also the U.S. House out of reach until 2032. The odds of Republicans earning a “lock” on the House go up even more if Democrats don’t win a significant number of seats in the midterms and the next presidential year. Worse yet, if Republicans maintain “trifecta” control of the federal government beyond 2020, they will almost certainly impose policies on the country whose implications are difficult to project, but that transcend any present slicing and dicing of the electorate. Winning back a significant share of the white working class vote at some future juncture may come too late if the New Deal policies that once made them vote for Democrats have been consigned to the dustbin of history. So the specific challenges of 2018 and 2020 need to be at the front of every progressive’s mind in considering the long-term regeneration of our electoral coalition."
"Here once again we are forced to question Agamben's teleo- logical mode of thought. Is this sovereign power represented in the concentration camps really a constitutive feature of sover- eignty tout court? Even limiting ouselves to the remarks above, we can imagine a liberal critique of this position that asks from where come the limitations that Agamben concedes previous Weimar governments had observed. Surely, one does not have to accept in its entirety a normative liberal conception of sovereign power in order to appreciate that the demand for a factual ac- counting for the decision on the exception, and institutional checks upon the totalization of the space of exception, can none- theless-at least in certain instances-be effective. Indeed, one could go further and suggest that a liberal theory of sovereign power understands full well the paradoxical relation between law and fact, norm and exception; and, precisely in light of such an understanding constructs an institutional system that cannot re- solve the paradox but nonetheless attempts to prevent it from reaching an intensified and catastrophic conclusion. Given that Agamben is a nuanced and fair-minded thinker, one must won- der about why he largely ignores such a system. We think that one possible answer is that,just as for Agamben the source of the problem is not the institutional operation of sovereign power, but its object-bare life-so too the solution is not a prolifera- tion of institutional safeguards but a rethinking of that mode of being. In this regard, we find his concluding musings on Heidig- ger to be suggestive."
"Researchers at Oxford University have produced the first list of global risks ‘that pose a threat to human civilisation, or even possibly to all human life.’ The report focuses on risks with ‘impacts that for all practical purposes can be called infinite’. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on it. And while human extinction might be a horrific, accidental side effect of climate change, a metorite impact or a super volcano, the report warns that AI might decide to cause our extinction deliberately (my emphasis): ...extreme intelligences could not easily be controlled (either by the groups creating them, or by some international regulatory regime), and would probably act to boost their own intelligence and acquire maximal resources for almost all initial AI motivations. And if these motivations do not detail the survival and value of humanity, the intelligence will be driven to construct a world without humans. This makes extremely intelligent AIs a unique risk, in that extinction is more likely than lesser impacts. AI is included, along with nanotechnology and synthetic biology, in a category of emerging risks. The emerging risks are poorly understood but also have the potential to solve many of the other problems on the list. The threat of AI comes from its potential to run away from us – it’s just possible that AI will end up working on itself and evolve beyond our understanding and control. At which point we’d better hope it likes us. Oxford University isn’t the first to draw attention to the potential threat posed by super-intelligent computers. Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, has warned about the dangers of AI repeatedly. Musk has described it as ‘our biggest existential threat‘ and taken on investments in AI companies just so that he can keep a close eye on what’s going on. Speaking to students at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) he likened it to a demon that, once summoned, won’t be controllable: With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it’s like - yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon. Doesn’t work out Bill Gates backed up Musk’s concerns during an ‘ask me anything’ session on Reddit: First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned. If two of history’s most successful technology entrepreneurs aren’t persuasive enough for you, how about the man they call The Greatest Living Physicist? Stephen Hawking, whose speech synthesiser uses a basic form of AI, isn’t a man with a lot of words to spare and when he spoke to the BBC about AI he was characteristically terse: The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded. Musk and Hawking are also two names among a veritable who’s who of AI luminaries who recently signed an open letter calling for research priorities focused on maximising the societal benefit of AI. What all these very intelligent people are reflecting is that we simply can’t predict how AI is going to develop, not least because AI might be a key tool in the development of AI. Perhaps the only sensible place to start then is to figure out a way of keeping a close eye on just exactly what is going on. Musk has his investments but computer scientist Eric Horvitz is thinking bigger. Horvitz has teamed up with Russ Altman, a professor of bioengineering and computer science at Stanford, to create AI100 – a 100-year study into Artificial Intelligence. Horvitz and Altman will join five others on a committee that will commission studies into how developments in AI will affects all aspects of human life over a number of generations. The committee members will obviously change over time but the committee itself, and the host, are planning to stick around and keep a close eye on things. If your goal is to create a process that looks ahead 30 to 50 to 70 years, it's not altogether clear what artificial intelligence will mean, or how you would study it ... But it's a pretty good bet that Stanford will be around One of the many things that AI100 will look at is the loss of control of AI systems and whether or not that could give rise to the kind of dystopic outcomes that the Oxford University researchers are trying to focus attention on. I can’t help wondering though; if we could look 100 years into the future and witness the final meeting of the AI100 committee, will anyone on it be human?"
"Carus in his study noted that, “to date, few terrorists have demonstrated an interest in bioterrorism, and fewer still tried to acquire biological agents. Unclassified accounts mention at least 54 cases in which a terrorist group allegedly had an interest in bioweapons, but there is little evidence to confirm most of these cases” (Carus, 2002). Of these 54 cases, only 27 have more than minimal evidence that a terrorist group actually acquired, attempted to acquire, or threatened to use a bioweapon. Eight of these cases produced evidence that the terrorist group actually acquired the agent, but in only five cases did terrorists confirm the use or attempted use of biological weapons (Carus, 2002). The five cases of bioterrorists Carus mentions are the Rajneeshees, Aum Shinrikyo, Dark Harvest, Mau Mau, and the Polish Resistance. The most prominent cases are the Rajneeshees and Aum Shinrikyo, which experienced the most success. To understand the roadblocks they nonetheless encountered, it is crucial to understand how these two organizations functioned and attempted to employ bioweapons."
"Some proponents of economic integration in North America have maintained that the emergence of China and India in the global marketplace may be putting North America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and that NAFTA should go beyond a free trade agreement. Some observers have proposed that the U.S. government consider the possibility of forming a customs union or common market.63 However, critics of this level of economic integration believe that NAFTA has already gone too far and that it has harmed the U.S. and Mexican economies and undermined democratic control of domestic policy-making.64 If the United States were to potentially consider the further economic integration in North America, it would require cooperation by the governments of Mexico and Canada, and approval by the U.S. Congress. Expanding NAFTA to a customs union or common market is not likely to happen within the foreseeable future. A possible option to address Mexico’s income disparities with the United States is to consider expanding the mandate of the North American Development Bank (NADBank). NADBank and its sister institution, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), were created under a bilateral side agreement to NAFTA called the Border Environmental Cooperation Agreement. The objective of NADBank and BECC is to help U.S.-Mexico border communities plan and finance environmental infrastructure projects. Some Members of Congress and elected officials from Mexico have informally discussed the possibility of expanding the mission of the NADBank to go beyond environmental and border issues. One possibility would be to expand NADBank projects to include transportation and other types of infrastructure projects. Another option would be to expand eligible projects to the entire region of Mexico instead of just the border area. Some policymakers have suggested the possibility of creating an infrastructure fund that would be managed by NADBank to provide investment in infrastructure, communications, or education."
"The ports of Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore have completed projects that put them in position to be the first to receive the big ships, some of them 1,110 feet long with the capacity to haul up to 13,000 boxcar-size freight containers, Ellis said. Elsewhere, the work is in varying stages: The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to finish dredging a 50-foot deep channel to three terminals in New York Harbor by the end of the year and to the main New York terminal by 2014, according to New York/New Jersey Port Authority spokesman Hunter Pendarvis. The authority has committed $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge by 64 feet to allow the bigger ships to pass under, he said. Miami-Dade County reached an agreement in April with environmental groups that had raised concerns about the Port of Miami's Deep Dredge project. It is expected to be able to handle the big ships by 2014 or soon thereafter, according to Ellis. The Corps of Engineers completed a study in April finding that Savannah, Ga.'s proposed $652-million channel deepening project is viable. The Corps is in the midst of a study of Charleston harbor, said Jim Newsome, president and CEO of the South Carolina Ports Authority. Philadelphia and Corpus Christi are currently involved in dredging projects, according to Ellis. Boston, Jacksonville, Canaveral and Freeport, Texas, are among other ports pursuing deeper channels, he said."
"To summarize, we have demonstrated that there is a military and civilian gap, at least when we compare higher-ranking elite military officers and civilian elites. On some measures, elite military officers appear far more similar to the mass public in their pattern of confidence in major American institutions than do the presumed leaders of those institutions, the civilian elites, This should alert us to subtleties underlying confidence in the military. In the rest of this chapter, we provide some exploratory examinations of how the notions of ""confidence"" may be profitably unpacked. The analysis thus far suggests that confidence in the military may not be as solid and stable as the commonly reported Gallup results imply. People who have little or no contact with the military express lower levels of confidence in the military. The effect is sharpest at the elite level, where an absence of contact with the military can have a large impact on expressed confidence, Nevertheless, majorities even among the least pro-military groups express confidence in the military. Thus, to a certain extent, the conventional wisdom is correct: American civil-military relations are blessed by the remarkable degree of confidence the military enjoys from the mass and elite public. But does this confidence extend beyond a mere appreciation that the military is capable of doing what it is askedto do? Is there an underlying sense of alienation between the groups, acknowledged or latent? Is there a consensus on how civil-military relations affects military effectiveness or on the day-to-day workings of civilian control? To answer these questions, we analyze civilian and military opinion across a broader range of topics."
"Policy Considerations¶ The rise of regional alternatives to the OAS presents both potential opportunities and challenges¶ for the United States. One potential benefit of such organizations might be an increase in burdensharing¶ in the hemisphere. As the newer organizations evolve, they may be able to take on more¶ responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in their sub-regions, which could enable¶ Congress to dedicate scarce U.S. resources to other priorities. A division of labor among various¶ organizations might also enable the OAS to better concentrate its efforts on its core agenda and¶ thereby carry out its mandates more effectively.¶ At the same time, an increasing role for other multilateral organizations could lead to a weaker,¶ more divided OAS. If other organizations take on larger roles in the hemisphere, the role of the¶ OAS would likely decline. Some Members of Congress argue that such a development could¶ weaken U.S. influence in the hemisphere since the OAS is the only multilateral organization in¶ which the United States is a member and shapes policy decisions.122 Moreover, the proliferation¶ of regional organizations could further weaken the hemisphere’s ability to speak with one voice.¶ For example, Mercosur and Unasur determined that the rapid June 2012 impeachment of¶ Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo constituted a break in the democratic order and sought to¶ isolate the country by suspending it from participation.123 The OAS, on the other hand, concluded¶ that the impeachment did not constitute a coup d’état, and member states decided not to suspend¶ Paraguay from participating in the organization.124¶ The impetus behind the creation of some of the new regional organizations also has implications¶ for the United States. Latin American leaders have established new multilateral institutions for a¶ number of reasons, one of which is the lingering view of many in the region that the OAS is an¶ institution dominated by the United States. Even as some Members of Congress assert that the¶ organization acts against U.S. interests, a number of policymakers in the broader region argue that¶ the OAS imposes U.S. policies. Given these views, some analysts maintain that “any reform to¶ the OAS that begins in Washington, especially in the U.S. Congress, can have the potential to¶ backfire” and provoke opposition in the hemisphere.125"
"Former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden on Monday marveled at the puny nature of the surveillance reforms put in place two years after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed a vast expansion of intrusive U.S. government surveillance at home and abroad.¶ Hayden mocked the loss of the one program that was reined in — the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata information about domestic phone calls — calling it “that little 215 program.”¶ And he said if someone had told him two years ago that the only effect of the Snowden revelations would be losing it, his reaction would have been: “Cool!”¶ Here is the video and the full text of his remarks:¶ If somebody would come up to me and say “Look, Hayden, here’s the thing: This Snowden thing is going to be a nightmare for you guys for about two years. And when we get all done with it, what you’re going to be required to do is that little 215 program about American telephony metadata — and by the way, you can still have access to it, but you got to go to the court and get access to it from the companies, rather than keep it to yourself” — I go: “And this is it after two years? Cool!”¶ Hayden was speaking at the annual meeting of the Wall Street Journal CFO Network, an event hosted “by the Journal’s senior editors” for “an invitation-only group of more than 100 chief financial officers of the world’s largest companies.”¶ Asked if he thought Snowden was a foreign agent, Hayden said: “I’ve got my suspicions,” although he acknowledged, “I’ve got no evidence.”¶ Some opponents of massive government surveillance hailed the passage, earlier this month, of the USA Freedom Act. And it did, in fact, mark the first time that Congress has limited the executive branch’s surveillance authority over four decades of explosive growth.¶ But some observers noted that it was a very small step at best. The program was just one out of the multitude Snowden revealed — and was so blatantly out of line that its end was virtually a foregone conclusion as soon as it was exposed.¶ Seemingly irreconcilable media coverage reflected the reality that the reform bill was both important and, from the NSA’s perspective, trivial.¶ Hayden’s remarks were the most blunt yet emphasizing that latter point."
"MOSCOW — In American presidential politics, high oil prices are a problem. For Vladimir V. Putin’s new presidential term in Russia, they will be a necessity — crucial to fulfilling his campaign promises to lift government spending by billions of dollars a year. Related Times Topic: Vladimir Putin Add to Portfolio Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Pool photo by Alexei Druzhinin Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaking in Kemerovo, Russia. The reality of his ambitious spending proposals is setting in. But doing that without busting the Kremlin’s budget would require oil to reach and sustain a price it has never yet achieved — $150 a barrel, according to one estimate by Citigroup. No wonder economists who specialize in Russia are skeptical. (On Friday, Russia’s Ural Blend export-grade oil was trading at $120 on the global spot market.) “It’s very hard to overestimate how vulnerable the Russian economy is to external pressures” from the oil price, Sergei Guriev, the rector of the New Economic School in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. “That vulnerability is huge, which is why Russia must be very vigilant. The spending is a risk.” The promised spending is also ambitious. Mr. Putin has laid out a program of raising wages for doctors and teachers, padding retirement checks for everyone and refurbishing Russia’s military arsenal. The oil-lubricated offerings would even include a population premium: expanding the popular “baby bonus” payments the Russian government provides to mothers, to include a third child. The payment, of up to $8,300 for housing or baby-related expenses, now comes as an incentive only with each of the first two children. The additional cost of the expanded baby benefits alone will total $4.6 billion a year, according to an estimate by the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Most of Mr. Putin’s spending promises came at least partly in response to the street demonstrations by young and middle-class protesters in Moscow and other big cities challenging his authority in the weeks leading up to the March 4 election. His apparent aim was to shore up support from the rest of Russia: poorer and rural parts of the country, and from state workers and the elderly. The repercussions of his campaign promises, and an earlier commitment on military spending, could be felt for years to come, giving price swings in oil a bigger role than ever on the Russian economy. Taxes on oil and natural gas sales provide half of Russia’s government revenue. Each increase in the Russian budget equivalent to 1 percent of the gross domestic product requires a rise in the price of oil of about $10 a barrel on global markets — which is how Citigroup arrived at the $150-a-barrel figure for meeting the new obligations Mr. Putin has taken on. Analysts worry that, even if the government can fulfill its promises, too little will remain for a sovereign wealth fund that is intended as a shock absorber for the Russian economy and the ruble exchange rate . Russia needed to use that buffer as recently as 2008, during the financial crisis. “The concern is simple,” Kingsmill Bond, the chief strategist at Citigroup in Russia, said in a telephone interview. “If the oil price that Russia requires to balance its budget is higher, the systemic risks that the market faces are also higher.” The bank estimated that Mr. Putin’s promises of higher wages and pensions, not counting the military outlays, add up to additional spending equal to 1.5 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product. That comes on top of an earlier pledge to spend an additional 3 percent of gross domestic product a year re-arming the military. In all, the new commitments would add up to about $98 billion a year, Citigroup estimates. The spillover from the Arab Spring and the specter of an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear development plants are propping up oil prices now. But over the long term, economic stagnation in Europe could help bring them down. Even before the election, Russia’s government spending was up, helping reinforce Mr. Putin’s message that he was the best candidate to deliver prosperity and stability. In January, the Russian military ministry, for example, doubled salaries in the nation’s million-person army. It was ostensibly a long-planned move. But coming just two months before the presidential vote, the political message was clear. Also smoothing the path for Mr. Putin’s victory was a national cap on utility rates that helped keep inflation at the lowest level in Russia’s post-Soviet history for January and February, at a 3.7 percent annual pace. “Putin made large spending commitments,” the Fitch rating agency said in a statement released the day after the election. “The current high price of oil cushions Russia’s public finances,” Fitch said. “But in the absence of fiscal tightening that significantly cuts the non-oil and gas fiscal deficit, a severe and sustained drop in the oil price would have a damaging impact on the Russian economy and public finances and would likely lead to a downgrade” of the nation’s credit rating. As Mr. Putin’s spending promises started to be introduced in January, Fitch altered Russia’s outlook to stable, from positive. Mr. Putin has defended the proposed spending as necessary and just, given the hardship of teachers and other public sector workers in the post-Soviet years. “A doctor, a teacher, a professor, these people should make enough money where they work so they don’t have to look for a side job,” Mr. Putin wrote in a manifesto published during the campaign. But in fact, the government will offset a portion of the pay raises, perhaps as much as one-third of their cost, by laying off some public sector workers and trimming some other public spending. That was the word from Lev I. Yakobson, the deputy rector of the Higher School of Economics, who helped draft the policy. That part of the plan, though, was never part of Mr. Putin’s stump speech."
"The term “homophobia” was first coined by G Weinberg (1972) to mean “the irrational condemnation of homosexual individuals, which results in violence, deprivation, and separation”. For some the term is not adequate to express the extent of the oppression of people on account of their sexual identity. In psychology phobia denotes fear, usually irrational. Some feel what is called homophobia is much more than just an irrational fear. It is a prejudice which often leads to acts of discrimination, abuse and violence. Homo which means “the same” places the emphasis on the oppressed rather than on the oppressors. Alternative terms presented are: gay and/or lesbian hatred or hating, sexual orientationalism (along with racism, sexism, etc) and heterosexism, “defined as both the belief that heterosexuality is or should be the only acceptable sexual orientation and the fear and hatred of those who love and sexually desire those of the same sex” (Blumenfeld 1992:15). Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment and violence. It is driven by fear and hatred. The term heterosexism includes both the cultural precedence of heterosexuality and what is commonly referred to as homophobia. Some prefer to retain the term homophobia since it has become entrenched and is widely used by all groups and also by the media. Blumenfeld (1992:18) summarises it as follows: [W]e are all born into a great pollution called homophobia (one among many forms of oppression), which falls on us like acid rain. For some people spirits are tarnished to the core, others are marred on the surface, and no one is completely protected. But neither are we to blame. We had no control over the formulation of this Hegemony and the internalisation of homophobia 6 HTS 63(1) 2007 pollution, nor did we direct it to pour down on us. On the other hand, we all have a responsibility, indeed an opportunity, to join together to construct shelter from the corrosive effect of oppression while working to clean up the homophobic environment in which we live. Once sufficient steps are taken to reduce this pollution, we will all breathe a lot easier. Since the seventies “homophobia”, denoting negative attitudes towards homosexual people, has become a more general term (see Gough 2002:219). Audrey Lorde (1988:321) defines homophobia as “a terror surrounding feelings of love for members of the same sex and thereby a hatred of those feelings in others” and heterosexism as “a belief in the inherent superiority of one form of loving over all others and thereby the right to dominance”. Together they mirror a culture of “heteronormativity”, which, according to Oesterreich (2002:288; cf Blumenfeld 1992), is “the idea that society and political economy presuppose the consistent pairing of women and men … Consequently, heteronormativity inherently limits who is counted as a citizen and the ways in which a citizen can participate in democratic citizenship.” Gender is construed by society to be a matter of “either/or”: one is either male or female. There is nothing in between. Gender norm deviations are punished by social means such as stereotyping and labelling (see Thorne 1995; Wong et al 1999; West & Zimmerman 1987). In order to make the label stick, traits which emphasize their “abnormality” are exaggerated – gay men as effeminate and gay women as “butch”. Homophobia is the consequence of this, embedded in a society that tends to conceptualise gender in a binary way (see Bem 1993; Gagne, Tewksbury & McGaughey 1997:478-508; Ingraham 1994:203-219; Wong et al 1999:19-31)."
"If we accept biospherical egalitarianism, then humans should be treated in no special way; humans are not to be set part from nature. But by arguing that natural states occur only when an ecosystem is left untouched by humans, Naess and others are implicitly separating humans from nature. What human do turns out to be unnatural. Hence, there is an internal inconsistency. Further, all human actions must be seen as natural -- including environmentally destructive ones. Only then do we have humans as being intimately part of nature. Watson then asks: Should we not, though, halt our environmentally destructive behaviour? Yes, he answers, but only because it is in our best interests to do so. Clearly, then, we have reduced the outlook back to anthropocentrism. Human beings ought to curb their evolutionary tendencies, rather than let them flow as Naess and others argue, because we have such a great potential for being destructive. The fact that only human behaviour is subject to moral evaluation does set us apart. If we really are merely members of the biotic community, then surely egalitarianism implies that we ought not to be treated differently. But most non-anthropocentric ethical systems prescribe constraints only on human conduct."
"It has been widely acknowledged that the federal government has lost control of our national finances. Deficits are approaching $1 trillion every year, about 70 percent of the budget is on autopilot, total public debt now exceeds $22 trillion, and total public debt to gross domestic product has almost doubled from 54 percent at the end of calendar 2000 to around 105 percent at the end of calendar 2018, and it continues to rise further. The truth is that the current budget system is badly broken and needs major reforms. In addition, the Constitution does not provide adequate protections designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and intergenerational equity. Since the beginning of the new millennium, several political and economic figures have stated that we should not be concerned. Recall that former Vice President Cheney said that “deficits do not matter.” In fairness, he may have been speaking politically rather than economically, but it was an irresponsible comment. He also said that the United States would make money on the second war with Iraq. How did that turn out? More recently, some prominent economists, including Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman, have espoused a “modern monetary theory.” This theory essentially states that deficits do not matter and assumes the nation can borrow at reasonable interest rates without limit due to our dominant reserve currency status. It assumes that the United States is exempt from the law of prudent finances, and that public and private interests will always have confidence in the United States irrespective of its policies. That is not a prudent or logical assumption. It is also contrary to history. The federal government has been using budget control mechanisms have failed to ensure fiscal prudence and sustainability for the future. As a result, the time has come to make the following budget reforms to promote fiscal sanity, sustainable growth, and intergenerational equity. First, the federal government should move to biennial budgets. After all, Congress has passed timely annual budgets and appropriation bills four times over the past 67 years. That performance de”serves a grade of F. The federal government should adopt separate operational and capital budgets like a vast majority of the states have. The current unified federal budget approach has served to constrain needed infrastructure and other investments that benefit multiple generations while also failing to control mandatory spending. There should be automatic continuing resolutions based on prior year recurring spending if the Congress does not pass an appropriations bill by the start of the fiscal year. Shutdowns are extremely disruptive and are certainly not in the interest of American taxpayers. The federal government should adopt a “no budget no pay” policy like California. Under this policy, members of Congress would not get paid if all appropriations bills were not passed by the beginning of the fiscal year. The pay for lawmakers would be resumed once all appropriations bills are passed, but there would be no retroactive pay. Members of Congress are responsible for passing annual appropriations bills, and they need to be held accountable and suffer the consequences if they fail to do their jobs. The debt ceiling should be repealed and replaced with a statutory debt to gross domestic product limit. The current debt ceiling has failed, and the United States is the only major nation that has such a limit. In addition, most industrialized nations focus on debt to gross domestic product as the most appropriate measure of fiscal sustainability. Such a measure would encourage economic growth policies that are fiscally sustainable. Given the seriousness of our fiscal challenge and the failure of statutory budget control approaches in the past, Congress should pass a federal fiscal responsibility amendment to the Constitution that, among other things, limits debt to gross domestic product to no more than a stated percentage absent a formal declaration of war or a supermajority vote by the Congress. This provision would have to be acted on each fiscal year that the limit would otherwise apply. Violation of this provision should result in no member of Congress being able to campaign for reelection. If the Congress fails to pass a fiscal responsibility amendment, the states should exercise their power under Article V of the Constitution and do so through a single issue convention. At the moment, there are 28 states of the required 34 states that have already passed the required resolution. The above reforms should help to restore fiscal sanity to our nation over time. They would also help us discharge our stewardship responsibility to our children, our grandchildren, and all future generations of Americans."
"Discourses about school bullying and school safety for LGTBQ youth locate homophobic, transphobic, and misogynistic harassment as external to the standards, goals, and daily practices of schools. Yet, as I have demonstrated here, the pathologization of homosexuality, and the valorization of heterosexuality, are actually central to much sexuality education policy and curricula. And these are only the most visible and explicit of these forms of heteronormativity. The institutions and the larger socio-cultural-legal structures that surround the debates around school bullying elide the extent to which heteronormativity structures school standards, curricula and state education policies. In other words, while we frequently hear critiques (and fears) over the ‘promotion of homosexuality’ in schools when policies and curricula are inclusive and accepting of LGBTQ individuals and families, the range of explicit and implicit educational policies and curricula that promote heteronormativity are rarely central to public debates about the safety of LGBTQ students. The fact that in some schools students are explicitly told that their sexual desires are immoral, unhealthy or socially unacceptable is not central to debates about homophobic bullying. The findings of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) 2011 School Climate Survey suggests that further research and advocacy are needed on this. ‘A greater percentage of LGBT students regularly experienced verbal harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in schools with abstinence- only curricula’ (GLSEN, 2012: 50). In schools with abstinence-only sexuality education, 65.9% of students reported harassment due to sexual orientation and 48% due to gender identity, compared with 55.5% and 41.2% in schools with ‘other sexual health education’ (GLSEN, 2012: 50). Moreover GLSEN found ‘inclusive curriculum’ defined as ‘curriculum that includes positive representations of LGBT people, history and events’ (2012: xvi), correlated with lower rates of absenteeism, ‘a greater sense of connectedness,’ less homophobic language prevalent in schools, and greater reported acceptance. GLSEN reports that, ‘less than half (43.4%) of students in schools with an inclusive curriculum felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation, compared to almost two thirds (67.5%) of other students’ (2012: xvi). This evidence suggests that the state’s policies and curriculum may indeed legitimate homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and racist bullying in schools. If advocates and researchers are correct in linking homophobic bullying with higher suicide rates (GLSEN, 2010), then it is important to investigate the larger socio-cultural contexts of such bullying and raise a set of critical questions about these contexts. What are the consequences of the state’s articulation of belonging, normativity, and responsible citizenship in and through heterosexual familial and sexual reproduction? How do we think about belonging in the classroom, and in the nation in the context of the state’s promotion of heterosexuality through abstinence-only education? How do we think about what kinds of citizen-subjects schools are mandated to produce? The pedagogical solution to the problem I lay out here is not simply the inclusion of LGBTQ sexual behaviors in sexuality education policy, which supplements heteronormativity with homonormativity and leaves untouched hierarchies of normative and deviant sexual and familial lives (see e.g. Rubin, 1989). Nor does the solution lie in the criminalization of homophobic bullying, which shores up a prison industrial complex that disproportionately enacts state violence against LGBTQ youth of color (Spade, 2011). As scholars and activists imagine coalition building around these issues, it is vital that we not only ‘deconstruct heterosexuality first’ (Duggan, 1994), but that we take up the complicated co-constitutativeness of racism, white supremacy, heteronormativity, and the regulation of sexuality in schools, media, and law. The promotion of heteronormativity in sexuality eduation effectively does the epistemological work of the schoolyard bully – insisting that the LGBTQ teenager should not exist. Moreover, it implicitly legitimates the homophobic language and other forms of homophobic violence to which LGBTQ youth are subjected on a daily basis (see endnote 3). The political promise of Duggan’s challenge requires that we make the complex, damaging, and often violent effects of ‘‘the promotion of heterosexuality’’ visible."
"Whether the sensitivities of the Arctic littoral states to cooperation with the three non-littoral states, or mutual mistrust between Russia and the other states, will prevent such an architecture from being formed is the main unknown in Arctic security. For the time being, however, while there remains suspicion among some Arctic states – and occasional bouts of belligerent rhetoric and the procurement of some equipment, which suggests state-based rivalry – the reality is that the Arctic is not witnessing an uncontrolled or substantially competitive militarisation. It is a region that has inherent strategic value, given the patrols of ballistic-missile submarines, but it is also one in which operations are hampered by weather and geography. While Russian defence spending has increased rapidly, it is from a remarkably low base and investments are currently just rejuvenating an entirely dilapidated fleet. Most Nordic budgets are constrained by austerity, US defence priorities lie elsewhere and Canada’s primary Arctic-focused procurement is of vessels devoted to maritime security. There may be more military activity in the Arctic in the future, but it is currently far from being a battleground for rival states."
"While states and LEAs will now have greater responsibility and a more uniform methodological approach to disproportionate representation identification, the framework remains largely unchanged from the old approach based upon principles of education federalism.165 Overall, the new provisions continue to require states to use a standard methodology to determine whether there is significant disproportionality based on race or ethnicity.166 Each state must set “reasonable risk ratio threshold[s],” and “reasonable” minimum number of students within a reported subgroup.167 However, states are still given great flexibility as to how to determine when significant disproportionality exists.168 In fact, states can choose not to identify an LEA that has previously exceeded risk ratio thresholds as an LEA with significant disproportionality as long as the LEA is making “reasonable” progress in lowering its risk ratio.169 As with the previous regulations, the state sets its own determination for what constitutes “reasonable” progress.170 Thus, the concern remains that the new approach to examining, identifying, and rectifying disproportionate representation of racial or ethnic minority students with disabilities will not adequately address the underlying civil rights issues that remain.171 Moreover, coupled with case precedent firmly establishing that plaintiff parents and students need more than a showing of an IDEA finding of significant disproportionality or patterns of inappropriate district-wide identification and assessment procedures for special education placements to prove intentional discrimination, how do potential plaintiff parents and students best ensure that states and LEAs are engaged in equitable practices and enforcement with the special education identification and assessment processes? This Conclusion outlines several considerations for future practice"
"The biggest single problem in societies aspiring to be democratic has been their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services (especially education, health care and infrastructure) that are needed to achieve individual opportunity. Proponents of democracy focus, for understandable reasons, on limiting the powers of tyrannical or predatory states. But they don't spend as much time thinking about how to govern effectively. They are, in Woodrow Wilson's phrase, more interested in ""controlling than in energizing government."" This was the failure of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which toppled Viktor Yanukovych for the first time. The leaders who came to power through those protests—Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko—wasted their energy on internal squabbling and shady deals. Had an effective democratic administration come to power, cleaning up corruption in Kiev and making the state's institutions more trustworthy, the government might have established its legitimacy across Ukraine, including the Russian-speaking east, long before Mr. Putin was strong enough to interfere. Instead, the democratic forces discredited themselves and paved the way for Mr. Yanukovych's return in 2010, thus setting the stage for the tense, bloody standoff of recent months. India has been held back by a similar gap in performance when compared with authoritarian China. It is very impressive that India has held together as a democracy since its founding in 1947. But Indian democracy, like sausage-making, doesn't look very appealing on closer inspection. The system is rife with corruption and patronage; 34% of the winners of India's recent elections have criminal indictments pending against them, according to India's Association for Democratic Reforms, including serious charges like murder, kidnapping and sexual assault. The rule of law exists in India, but it is so slow and ineffective that many plaintiffs die before their cases come to trial. The Indian Supreme Court has a backlog of more than 60,000 cases, according to the Hindustan Times. Compared with autocratic China, the world's largest democracy has been completely hamstrung in its ability to provide modern infrastructure or basic services such as clean water, electricity or basic education to its population. In some Indian states, 50% of schoolteachers fail to show up for work, according to the economist and activist Jean Drèze. Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist with a troubling past of tolerating anti-Muslim violence, has just been elected prime minister by an impressive majority in the hope that he will somehow cut through all the blather of routine Indian politics and actually get something done. Americans, more than other people, often fail to understand the need for effective government, focusing instead on the constraint of authority. In 2003, the George W. Bush administration seemed to believe that democratic government and a market-oriented economy would spontaneously emerge in Iraq once the U.S. had eliminated Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. It didn't understand that these arise from the interaction of complex institutions—political parties, courts, property rights, shared national identity—that have evolved in developed democracies over many decades, even centuries. The inability to govern effectively extends, unfortunately, to the U.S. itself. Our Madisonian Constitution, deliberately designed to prevent tyranny by multiplying checks and balances at all levels of government, has become a vetocracy. In the polarized—indeed poisonous—political atmosphere of today's Washington, the government has proved unable to move either forward or backward effectively. Contrary to the hysterics on either side, the U.S. faces a very serious long-term fiscal problem that is nonetheless solvable through sensible political compromises. But Congress hasn't passed a budget, according to its own rules, in several years, and last fall, the GOP shut down the entire government because it couldn't agree on paying for past debts. Though the U.S. economy remains a source of miraculous innovation, American government is hardly a source of inspiration around the world at the present moment. Twenty-five years later, the most serious threat to the end-of-history hypothesis isn't that there is a higher, better model out there that will someday supersede liberal democracy; neither Islamist theocracy nor Chinese capitalism cuts it. Once societies get on the up escalator of industrialization, their social structure begins to change in ways that increase demands for political participation. If political elites accommodate these demands, we arrive at some version of democracy."

"Those who get in their way or challenge their “rights” are vilified, criminalized and to an increasing degree defined as “terrorists” or, in the case of defiant governments, as “rogue states” – a label that usually implies threatened or actual military attack, as we can see in the cases of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and maybe Syria and Iran in the near future. U.S. President Bush had even spoken of the possibility of “preemptive” nuclear strikes should the U.S. feel endangered by weapons of mass destruction.[42] The European Union did not object.[43] Neoliberalism and war are two sides of the same coin.[44] Free trade, piracy and war are still “an inseparable three” – today maybe more so than ever. War is not only “good for the economy” but is indeed its driving force and can be understood as the “continuation of economy with other means”.[45] War and economy have become almost indistinguishable.[46] Wars about resources – especially oil and water – have already begun.[47] The Gulf Wars are the most obvious examples. Militarism once again appears as the “executor of capital accumulation” – potentially everywhere and enduringly.[48] Human rights and rights of sovereignty have been transferred from people, communities and governments to corporations.[49] The notion of the people as a sovereign body has practically been abolished. We have witnessed a coup of sorts. The political systems of the West and the nation state as guarantees for and expression of the international division of labor in the modern world system are increasingly dissolving.[50] Nation states are developing into “periphery states” according to the inferior role they play in the proto-despotic “New World Order”.[51] Democracy appears outdated. After all, it “hinders business”.[52] The “New World Order” implies a new division of labor that does no longer distinguish between North and South, East and West – today, everywhere is South. An according International Law is established which effectively functions from top to bottom (“top-down”) and eliminates all local and regional communal rights. And not only that: many such rights are rendered invalid both retroactively and for the future.[53] The logic of neoliberalism as a sort of totalitarian neo-mercantilism is that all resources, all markets, all money, all profits, all means of production, all “investment opportunities”, all rights and all power belong to the corporations only. To paraphrase Richard Sennett: “Everything to the Corporations!”[54] One might add: “Now!” The corporations are free to do whatever they please with what they get. Nobody is allowed to interfere. Ironically, we are expected to rely on them to find a way out of the crisis we are in. This puts the entire globe at risk since responsibility is something the corporations do not have or know. The times of social contracts are gone.[55] In fact, pointing out the crisis alone has become a crime and all critique will soon be defined as “terror” and persecuted as such.[56]"
"Conflict and US Military Spending How does one measure polarity? Power is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted formula exists. Perhaps overall military spending might be thought of as a proxy for hard power capabilities; perhaps too the amount of money the United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of the unipole. When compared to conflict levels, however, there is no obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative relationship between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic stability theorists would expect to see. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on defense by about 25 percent, spending $100 billion less in real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 To those believers in the neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible “peace dividend” endangered both national and global security. “No serious analyst of American military capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America’s responsibilities to itself and to world peace,” argued Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 The world grew dramatically more peaceful while the United States cut its forces, however, and stayed just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the military budget was cut under President Clinton, in other words, and kept declining (though more slowly, since levels were already low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up. Overall US military spending has varied during the period of the New Peace from a low in constant dollars of less than $400 billion to a high of more than $700 billion, but war does not seem to have noticed. The same nonrelationship exists between other potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict: there does not seem to be much connection between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP, alliance commitments, and forward military presence. There was very little fighting in Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there, for example, and that has not changed as the number of Americans dwindled by 90 percent. Overall, there does not seem to be much correlation between US actions and systemic stability. Nothing the United States actually does seems to matter to the New Peace."
"To be a fraudulent person, on the other hand, is to be caught impersonating a human being. There is only one such position in the anti-black world and it belongs to the black. As DuBois once put it, blacks are constructed not as people with problems, but rather as ""a problem people.""20 Slave codes in the southern United States demanded that slaves receive clothing, food, and lodging sufficient to their basic needs. Slaves, although dead to civil rights and responsibilities-social death-are reduced to nothing but the physical body, unprotected against mutilation or torture.21 The functioning of social death is, again, premised on the context itself as anti-black. The post-Emancipation era of the Black Codes, convict leasing, and lynching ensured that blackness meant social death not by virtue of enslavement, but instead as a product of criminality and imprisonment. Blackness remains to this day the essential marker of criminality and deviance.22 Black existence and its signifier ""criminal,"" then, serve a central metaphorical and structural purpose for a white supremacist bourgeois society. In the con temporary debates on immigration, it provides the menacing content for the construct ""criminal"" that gives the anti immigrant position its purchase in main stream society. To put it differently, we as educators cannot effectively undo the racism of anti-immigrant discourse without also challenging the anti-blackness of crime and punishment. In concrete terms, moreover, we need to recall the destruction of the black community base, the deindustrialization of the political economy, dismantling of the welfare state, and the installment of the prison industrial complex. These processes collectively produced a black population available on a massive scale for social transfer to the living death of prison cages. These dislocations and debasements were the conditions of possibility for the political economy that draws immigrants to this country, while at the same time, the institutionalization of the (vanquished) black liberation movement serves as the pre requisite for the very struggles against the exploitation of immigrant labor that have, rightfully, gained momentum today.23 In other words, there would be no immigrant labor to speak of if the black liberation movement had not been systematically destroyed, and, ironically, that very same social movement history would not otherwise be available to other oppressed groups to learn and benefit from. Needless to say, I have not been at all successful in realizing this kind of analysis with my students. In much of its practice, criminology is an exercise in bad faith in that it encourages students to flee a displeasing truth for a more com forting lie. The criminological discourse on immigration is an expression of bad faith as well. My students live this lie in their own ways. Although they know that ""crime"" is far more complex and messy than a simple case of immorality, the fact that the United States has the largest prison population in the world, both in total numbers and per capita, eighty per cent of whom are people of color, and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) holds some 23,000 people in immigration jails on a given day and about 200,000 annually, does not, in any sincere way, trouble them much.24 At some level in their consciousness, perhaps they know that people (immigrant and non-immigrant alike) do not have what they need to survive in this society, and that in their capacities as law enforcers, they are not making things better for these millions of people. These are tough ethical problems for young people emerging from a context in which their futures are mortgaged ever more by the racial state's commitment to the needs of capital."
"U.S. President Donald Trump, declaring a national emergency because of tensions with Iran, swept aside objections from Congress on Friday to complete the sale of over $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. The Trump administration informed congressional committees that it will go ahead with 22 military sales to the Saudis, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, infuriating lawmakers by circumventing a long-standing precedent for congressional review of major weapons sales. Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for months, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Lawmakers and congressional aides warned earlier this week that Trump, frustrated with Congress holding up weapons deals including the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia, was considering using a loophole in arms control law to go ahead by declaring a national emergency. “President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove ... There is no new ‘emergency’ reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there,” said Senator Chris Murphy. Murphy, a Democrat, made public on Twitter on Wednesday that Trump was considering the loophole in the Arms Control Export Act to clear the sales. Several of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, said they would object to such a plan, fearing that blowing through the “holds” process would eliminate Congress’ ability to check not just Trump but future presidents from selling weapons where they liked. Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said the administration’s action was “unfortunate” and likely to damage future White House interactions with Congress. “I would have strongly preferred for the administration to utilize the long-established and codified arms sale review process,” McCaul said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that U.S. partners in the Middle East needed the contracts to be completed to help deter Iran, and that the decision to circumvent Congress was meant to be a “one-time event.” It is not the first time Congress and Trump have clashed over policy in the region, or the division of powers between the White House and Capitol Hill. The House and Senate voted to end U.S. military support for the campaign in Yemen earlier this year, but Trump vetoed the resolution. BOON TO DEFENSE INDUSTRYIn documents sent to Congress, Pompeo listed a wide range of products and services that would be provided to the countries. They include Raytheon precision-guided munitions (PGMs), support for Boeing Co F-15 aircraft, and Javelin anti-tank missiles, which are made by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp. Other companies that will benefit include General Electric, now cleared to sell engines for use in F-16 fighter jets operated by the UAE and the U.S. unit of French firm Thales, which was cleared to sell a fuzing system for Paveway IV precision guided bombs to Britain and the UAE. It will also likely be welcome news for Britain’s BAE Systems Plc and Europe’s Airbus, clearing the way for installation of Paveway laser-guided bombs on European-built Eurofighter and Tornado fighter jets sold to Saudi Arabia, as well F-15 fighters built by Boeing. “I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump Administration has failed once again to prioritize our long-term national security interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favors to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia,” Senator Bob Menendez said in a statement. Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, vowed to fight the action, and said he was in talks with both Democrats and some of Trump’s fellow Republicans on ways to preserve congressional review of arms sales. The Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Republican Senator Jim Risch, said he had received formal notification of the administration’s intent to move forward. In a statement, Risch said, “I am reviewing and analyzing the legal justification for this action and the associated implications.” In his memorandum justifying the emergency declaration, Pompeo listed years of actions by Iran. “Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at home and abroad,” he wrote, and cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Tehran. Trump’s administration also announced that it was sending 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East, which it described as an effort to bolster defenses against Iran against what it sees as a threat of potential attack. Members of Congress from both parties have worried that Trump is pushing toward war with Iran. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, said the administration was responding to important needs from partners."
"There is no clear demand for large UUVs in the private sector in the near term. Small UUVs are more marketable because they provide for current needs and are easier to handle. It is, currently, not clear what commercial advantage a large UUV would offer that would offset the larger business cost. Using a dual commercial-government scenario the current availability of large displacement UUVs that could be used as is or be modified for use by the Navy is limited. Developing and proving the application of large UUVs in both military and commercial applications is necessary to create a market for these vehicles. Before a large UUV procurement can be pursued, the Navy must prove that it is worth the extra footprint and infrastructure required on the combatant ships of the future. Commercial manufacturers must prove that the additional burden required to operate a large displacement UUV is offset by its added functionality and capability. There is a large amount of anecdotal information suggesting that large UUVs with extended mission capabilities, endurance and autonomy can be a viable and cost effective systems in both the military and commercial marketplaces. However, hard data does not exist to convince commercial manufacturers, the Navy, commercial customers and academic research institutes to invest without engaging in some type of enterprise that shares the cost and risk burden. The only viable option that would create a win-win scenario appears to be for the Navy to partner with both a commercial firm and a research facility. In the current market where there is low demand for a large vehicle. Including a research facility (e.g., ARL PSU) would be essential to maximize vehicle utilization. This partnership could be used to develop a large displacement UUV to prove the increased utility and operational effectiveness of a larger vehicle in military, commercial and including research applications. This enhanced market attractiveness of a large displacement UUV, achieved by developing a strong case for its increased operational effectiveness, could put the partnership at the front of a bow wave of large UUV development that could place it far ahead of the competition"
"When the courts adopt a scholarly view of the law, we could de- scribe the decision as ""making law,"" but that term-as popular as it might be in our own idiom-obscures the tentative nature of claims of Right. The courts do not ""enact"" anything in subscribing to par- ticular principles. The principles come to prevail, but they are not legislated."
"While strengthening sanctions and security cooperation as outlined above, Japan, the United States, and South Korea must consider reestablishing the trilateral North Korea policy coordination mechanism. President-elect Trump has demonstrated that he believes in taking a bilateral approach to the resolution of international issues. If the United States is to engage in bilateral negotiations with North Korea, prior consultation with its allies on its approach to North Korea will be essential. Japan, the United States, and South Korea will need to constantly reaffirm the importance of close policy coordination, which is the only way for us to be able to put an end to North Korea’s missile and nuclear development, transform North Korea into a country that respects human rights, and respond effectively to any contingencies on the Korean Peninsula."
"""U.S-Russian Relations: Is Conflict Inevitable?"" That was the title of a day-long conference on Monday at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. American and Russian experts analyzed the issue and VOA's Peter Fedynsky has this report on their discussion. The short answer to the question posed at the Hudson Institute is no. Armed conflict between the United States and Russia is neither inevitable nor likely. Indeed, Mikhail Delyagin, an adviser to former Russian Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov, says a struggle with the West in general it is not in the interests of Russian elites. He spoke through an interpreter. ""Representatives of the ruling groups have their bank accounts in the West. And the second point is to understand that the Russian army does not exist and the Russian economy is extremely weak. Our Black Sea fleet is not even at the level of the forces of Bulgaria and Romania,"" he said. One of the panel members at the Hudson Institute conference, Moscow political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky, says Russia and the United States, dominant powers of the 20th Century, now need to cooperate with one another. ""In the 21st century, both the West and Russia are in a much more vulnerable position. We are both challenged by Islamic radicalism, and then, maybe more long term and less obvious, but maybe more dangerous -- the potential challenge of a rising China,"" he said. Russian journalist Evgeny Kiselyev agrees that the United States and Russia have common interests. He says that Russians who communicate with Americans or have been to the United States generally have a good impression of this country. However, Kiselyev says some members of Russia's ruling class continue to resent America."
"In light of this, it is encouraging to see the new year begin with a Washington Post op-ed by Education secretary Arne Duncan on the importance of building on the reforms of No Child Left Behind to improve K–12 education in the United States. As is widely recognized, education reform represents an area in which the desire for — and substance of — reform is bipartisan. Thus, one line of reasoning is that this should be the first item of business for the new Congress, thereby establishing an ability to undertake bipartisan actions. This gets it wrong for four reasons. First, Congress has serious and pressing issues to resolve regarding the federal government’s overspending addiction and the upcoming debt limit, and those should come first. Education reform is not a dollar issue. Inflation-adjusted spending per student has roughly doubled over the past 20 years, but achievement has gone down — the problem is one of accountability. Accountability has three facets. First, it must be built upon a foundation of increased opportunity for school choice. If failure for students means failure for the teaching bureaucracy, that’s accountability. Second, it includes such state-level efforts as Florida’s, which gives grades to schools and energizes parents to demand improvements in subpar performers. Finally, it includes oversight of federal programs to ensure that the taxpayers’ dollars are used effectively. Second, while there are areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats, members need to take some time to find out what is happening on the ground before rushing to pass a reauthorization bill. This is especially true given the large influx of nearly 100 new House members and senators, all of whom will need to get up to speed on the facts in an area where urban legend often rules. For example, how did states and localities spend the stimulus funding (nearly $100 billion), “EduJobs” funding ($10 billion), and Race to the Top money they’ve gotten? Many states passed laws in the last year to improve their charter-school laws and to change the way they compensate high-performing teachers, in efforts to win Race to the Top grants. But the Race to the Top winners are only just now beginning to implement the reforms described in their applications. Are these reforms effective? Are they good models for others states? Given the importance of identifying and rewarding quality teaching (and identifying and eliminating low-quality teaching), these are questions that must be answered before taking the next steps. Third, as Congress takes steps to improve the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the top priority must be to keep students, parents, teachers, and communities first, as they are the ones on the front lines and most able to improve student achievement. This requires serious outreach, not the kind of Washington-centric, ram-it-through-before-they-catch-us mentality that has prevailed in the past two years. Finally, as members of Congress scrutinize the current law and digest the new reforms taken by states and localities, they must first and foremost ensure that their reauthorization balances the federal and local roles. The voters have made clear their distaste for federal overreach. Thus, for example, mandating that states adopt Common Core curriculum standards in order to receive funds is a step in the wrong direction. Instead, states should have the freedom to take this step on their own. At the same time, pretending that 100 percent local control would work is to de facto condemn the very students who need freedom from their failing schools. Getting this balance right will take time."
"Since 2006, the previous position of the Department of State, which originally had the lead in funding (and therefore some influence in controlling) these activities, has been eclipsed. While it continues to control funding for its many Title 22 programs, they are largely executed via DSCA and the MILDEPs. Although Congress has recognized that it has, in effect, created the basis for confusion via the two departments’ dual congressionally mandated authorities and authorizations, a political decision to create a clear lead agent for these activities remains missing. One will return to the U.S. Government’s well-used practice of “fudging” when it comes to identifying who’s in charge."
"Slavery and Social Death was widely reviewed and lavishly praised for its erudition and conceptual rigor. As a result of its success, social death has become a handy general definition of slavery, for many historians and non-historians alike. But it is often forgotten that the concept of social death is a distillation from Patterson’s breathtaking survey—a theoretical abstraction that is meant not to describe the lived experiences of the enslaved so much as to reduce them to a least common denominator that could reveal the essence of slavery in an ideal-type slave, shorn of meaningful heritage.6 As a concept, it is what Frederick Cooper has called an “agentless abstraction” that provides a neat cultural logic but ultimately does little to illuminate the social and political experience of enslavement and the struggles that produce historic transformations.7 Indeed, it is difficult to use such a distillation to explain the actual behavior of slaves, and yet in much of the scholarship that followed in the wake of Slavery and Social Death, Patterson’s abstract distillates have been used to explain the existential condition of the enslaved. Having emerged from the discipline of sociology, “social death” fit comfortably within a scholarly tradition that had generally been more alert to deviations in patterns of black life from prevailing social norms than to the worldviews, strategies, and social tactics of people in black communities. Together with Patterson’s work on the distortions wrought by slavery on black families, “social death” reflected sociology’s abiding concern with “social pathology”; the “pathological condition” of twentieth-century black life could be seen as an outcome of the damage that black people had suffered during slavery. University of Chicago professor Robert Park, the grand-pe`re of the social pathologists, set the terms in 1919: “the Negro, when he landed in the United States, left behind almost everything but his dark complexion and his tropical temperament.”8 Patterson’s distillation also conformed to the nomothetic imperative of social science, which has traditionally aimed to discover universal laws of operation that would be true regardless of time and place, making the synchronic study of social phenomena more tempting than more descriptive studies of historical transformation. Slavery and Social Death took shape during a period when largely synchronic studies of antebellum slavery in the United States dominated the scholarship on human bondage, and Patterson’s expansive view was meant to situate U.S. slavery in a broad context rather than to discuss changes as the institution developed through time. Thus one might see “social death” as an obsolete product of its time and tradition, an academic artifact with limited purchase for contemporary scholarship, were it not for the concept’s reemergence in some important new studies of slavery.9 WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED AS AMONG the most onerous of social institutions, slavery has much to tell us about the way human beings react to oppression. At the same time, the extreme nature of the institution naturally encourages a pessimistic view of the capacity for collective agency among subjugated people. As a result, trends in the study of slavery, as with the study of dominance more generally, often divide between works that emphasize the overwhelming power of the institution and scholarship that focuses on the resistant efforts of the enslaved. In turn, this division frames a problem in the general understanding of political life, especially for the descendants of the powerless. It might even be said that these kinds of studies form different and opposing genres—hopeful stories of heroic subalterns versus anatomies of doom—that compete for ascendance. In recent years, if the invocation of Patterson’s “social death” is any indication, the pendulum seems to have swung decidedly toward despair."
"First,  America's mature political institutions organized around the rule of law have made it a relatively predictable and cooperative hegemon. The pluralistic and regularized way in which U.S. foreign and security policy is made reduces surprises and allows other states to build long-term, mutually beneficial relations. The governmental separation of powers creates a shared decision-making system that opens up the process and reduces the ability of any one leader to make abrupt or aggressive moves toward other states. An active press and competitive party system also provide a service to outside states by generating information about U.S. policy and determining its seriousness of purpose. The messiness of a democracy can, indeed, frustrate American diplomats and confuse foreign observers. But over the long term, democratic institutions produce more consistent and credible policies--policies that do not reflect the capricious and idiosyncratic whims of an autocrat. Think of the United States as a giant corporation that seeks foreign investors. It is more likely to attract investors if it can demonstrate that it operates according to accepted accounting and fiduciary principles. The rule of law and the institutions of policymaking in a democracy are the political equivalent of corporate transparency and accountability. Sharp shifts in policy must ultimately be vetted within the policy process and pass muster by an array of investigatory and decision-making bodies.  Because it is a constitutional, rule-based democracy, outside states are more willing to work with the United States-or, to return to the corporate metaphor, to invest in ongoing partnerships."
"When the global financial crisis struck roughly a year ago, the blogosphere was ablaze with all sorts of scary predictions of, and commentary regarding, ensuing conflict and wars -- a rerun of the Great Depression leading to world war, as it were. Now, as global economic news brightens and recovery -- surprisingly led by China and emerging markets -- is the talk of the day, it's interesting to look back over the past year and realize how globalization's first truly worldwide recession has had virtually no impact whatsoever on the international security landscape. None of the more than three-dozen ongoing conflicts listed by GlobalSecurity.org can be clearly attributed to the global recession. Indeed, the last new entry (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah in the Palestine) predates the economic crisis by a year, and three quarters of the chronic struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican ""drug war"" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger (followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and liberation-themed terrorist movements. Besides the recent Russia-Georgia dust-up, the only two potential state-on-state wars (North v. South Korea, Israel v. Iran) are both tied to one side acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity -- a process wholly unrelated to global economic trends. And with the United States effectively tied down by its two ongoing major interventions (Iraq and Afghanistan-bleeding-into-Pakistan), our involvement elsewhere around the planet has been quite modest, both leading up to and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia's coast). Everywhere else we find serious instability we pretty much let it burn, occasionally pressing the Chinese -- unsuccessfully -- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example, hasn't led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces. So, to sum up: •No significant uptick in mass violence or unrest (remember the smattering of urban riots last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); •The usual frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places); •Not a single state-on-state war directly caused (and no great-power-on-great-power crises even triggered); •No great improvement or disruption in great-power cooperation regarding the emergence of new nuclear powers (despite all that diplomacy); •A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by the system's acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the strain); and •No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are Moscow's occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we've finally seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in the late 1980s, but even that's likely to wane given the stress on public budgets created by all this unprecedented ""stimulus"" spending. If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. Can we say that the world has suffered a distinct shift to political radicalism as a result of the economic crisis? Indeed, no. The world's major economies remain governed by center-left or center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both markets and trade. In the short run, there were attempts across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect, as much protectionism as allowed under current trade rules), but there was no great slide into ""trade wars."" Instead, the World Trade Organization is functioning as it was designed to function, and regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we say Islamic radicalism was inflamed by the economic crisis? If it was, that shift was clearly overwhelmed by the Islamic world's growing disenchantment with the brutality displayed by violent extremist groups such as al-Qaida. And looking forward, austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day, the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes, even as it has sparked a spirited -- and much needed, as I argued last week -- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it the beginning of ""economic warfare"" and the like between ""fading"" America and ""rising"" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated production chains and interconnected financial markets, such ""diverging interests"" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I don't welcome a world in which America's fiscal profligacy goes undisciplined, so bring it on -- please! Add it all up and it's fair to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience of America's post-World War II international liberal trade order."
"From WalMart’s recent campaign to call our attention to their eco-friendly practices to the good folks trying to sell us “clean coal,” corporations the world over have begun marketing themselves as crusaders for environmental sustainability. Recent events in the Gulf have tarnished the sheen of BP’s slick “beyond petroleum” marketing campaign, but it nonetheless stands as an oil-sodden monument to the strategy of transforming the growing environmental consciousness into fertilizer for their profit margins."
"An Arizona-based algae technology company says it’s on to something big: harnessing the growth of algae at a commercial scale so that it can ultimately be used as a transportation fuel. “Heliae” broke ground Friday on its new plant. Now, all it needs is an abundance of sunshine, water and carbon dioxide.¶ But while the ingredients to make algae may be simple, it is still an open question as to whether current pilot facilities can attract private investors that will enable the industry to gear up. Beyond the financial concerns, environmental worries persist. It can involve taking carbon emissions from power plants to grow the algae before converting it to something that would run cars, trucks and airplanes.¶ In a phone interview, Heliae’s Chief Executive Dan Simon explained to this writer that the company’s ultimate goal is to produce transportation fuels. To get to that point, though, it will focus on near-term aims that are more attainable: chemicals, cosmetics and healthy foods. As it develops, the enterprise will then expand overseas and into the Asia Pacific region.¶ “We will never take our eyes off the transportation fuels,” says Simon. “But there are stepping stones to get us there. Production costs have to come down. Right now, the economics don’t work. It will be 5 to 10 years before all of this will affect the price at the pump.”¶ Simon continues, saying that “good science takes time” and that by first picking the “low hanging fruit” the company will drive revenues and efficiencies, and bring down production costs. Among the key goals the company is working towards: Ensuring that the process has a “positive energy impact,” meaning that it can’t take more energy to grow the algae than the amount of carbon dioxide that the algae would absorb.¶ Critics maintain that the recycling of carbon lends credence to the burning of fossil fuels and in the end, more carbon is emitted than is captured. The journal of Environmental Science and Technology, furthermore, looked two years ago at the life cycle of algae compared to other bio-fuels such as corn and switch-grass. It concluded that using conventional crops to create fuels will result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less water consumption than if algae is used to do the same thing.¶ The study also says that most of the carbon that is getting captured is coming from places other than power plants and oil refineries. That’s because there is not yet an effective way to bottle such releases from industrial sources.¶ Those findings, however, have been refuted by the Algae Biomass Association, which says that researchers have used outdated data that is tied to older production methods to draw their conclusions. To that end, the industry, which has kept its production processes proprietary, is now saying that it may be willing to share its newest information so that such students can better understand today’s technologies.¶ “If it cost you more energy to make it, then what is the point,” says Nick Donowitz, director of corporate development for Heliae. “Based on the work we’ve done, we are charging on a path toward an energy neutral or energy positive system.”¶ Algae, today, is a blip on the radar. But, tomorrow, it may become a full-scale blimp. According to Pike Research, it could be a 61 million barrels a year commodity with a market value of $1.3 billion by 2020. That’s a compound growth rate of 72 percent, it adds. To put that in context, 83 million barrels of oil are consumed each day around the world. Of that, the United States uses about 18 million a day."
"My list of sins here is not novel. Many teachers I have spoken with are aware of these harmful effects of forced education, and many work hard to try to counteract them. Some try to instill as much of a sense of freedom and play as the system permits; many do what they can to mute the shame of failure and reduce anxiety; most try to allow and promote cooperation and compassion among the students, despite the barriers against it; many do what they can to allow and promote critical thinking. But the system works strongly against them, especially today as we move the system ever more toward its logical conclusions. It may even be fair to say that teachers in our school system are no freer to teach as they wish than are students to learn as they wish. One teacher, in response to an early sketch of this chapter, wrote, “I don’t choose what I teach; the state does. Teachers know wonderful things about how children learn, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it. . . . My ability to keep my job is based on how many of my students pass the [state-mandated] test.” But teachers, unlike students, are free to quit."
"While in Venezuela the people are asking themselves whether Maduro measures up to the job or not, other Chavist factions, such as the one led by Diosdado Cabello, are making life difficult for the new president. Cabello reacted to the visit by Capriles, forcing Maduro to speak out forthrightly. Chavez set the agenda in Venezuela; Maduro is having it imposed upon him."
"Counter-terrorism strategies and tactics are rightly in the consciousness of officials and civilians in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. While preventing future attacks should be a leading priority for government at all levels, officials must take care not to focus only on the threat of terrorist attacks. Doing so could diminish the resources, preparation, and skills needed for management of other disasters, and therefore result in greater risk to the population."
"The United States is confronted with real foreign-policy challenges that will prove hard to resolve: militant Islam; the Palestine conflict, which is now in its seventh decade; an aggressive Russia, insisting on asserting its power, at least in its own neighborhood; continuing threats of nuclear proliferation. We will need the cooperation of China to address many, if not all, of these problems. We should take this moment, as China becomes the world’s largest economy, to “pivot” our foreign policy away from containment. The economic interests of China and the U.S. are intricately intertwined. We both have an interest in seeing a stable and well-functioning global political and economic order. Given historical memories and its own sense of dignity, China won’t be able to accept the global system simply as it is, with rules that have been set by the West, to benefit the West and its corporate interests, and that reflect the West’s perspectives. We will have to cooperate, like it or not—and we should want to. In the meantime, the most important thing America can do to maintain the value of its soft power is to address its own systemic deficiencies—economic and political practices that are corrupt, to put the matter baldly, and skewed toward the rich and powerful. A new global political and economic order is emerging, the result of new economic realities. We cannot change these economic realities. But if we respond to them in the wrong way, we risk a backlash that will result in either a dysfunctional global system or a global order that is distinctly not what we would have wanted."
"Rodriguez said the ""extraterritoriality"" of the blockade measures - the fact that Washington pressures other countries to adhere to the U.S. embargo - violates international law. He added that the blockade is not in U.S. interests and harms its credibility."
"Sinn (2008, 2012) coined the term green paradox to describe the idea that a climate policy that becomes more ambitious during the decades ahead is an announced expropriation for the owners of fossil fuel resources, thus inducing them to accelerate resource extraction and global warming. It works as follows. A gradual tightening of climate policy over the coming decades exerts a stronger downward pressure on future prices than on current ones, thereby curbing the expected rate of capital appreciation of fossil fuel reserves. The owners of these fossil fuel deposits try to avert this scenario by increasing extraction rates and converting the sales revenue into investments in the capital markets, which offer higher yields. Hence, a climate policy that becomes more aggressive over time acts as an announced expropriation that provokes owners to react by accelerating the rate of extraction of their fossil fuel stocks and thereby exacerbating global warming. Sinn (2008) deserves credit for intensifying efforts to better understand the channels by which one can fight global warming. Furthermore, the problem is even more severe in an international context in which carbon leakage and the green paradox may reinforce each other.12 Countries that do not join in efforts to curb fossil fuel demand thus benefit in two ways: by burning the lower-priced carbon set free by the carbon-reducing countries and by burning the additional carbon extracted as a result of the announced and expected price cuts following the gradual increase in the carbon tax."
"The first use of hegemony in international environmental politics revolves around the use of superior power in the interest of international regime building. Young (1989:88) has argued in International Cooperation: Building Regimes for Natural Resources and the Environment that, even though hegemonic states rarely impose international regimes against the wishes of other states, they play an important role in providing leadership in the creation of mutually agreeable environmental regimes. Although environmental leadership does not necessarily result from hegemonic power, it is closely linked to such power. Environmental leadership can take many different forms: policy entrepreneurship of individual actors in international bargaining that facilitates compromise and agreement in the interest of environmental causes (entrepreneurial leadership); diffusion and role model effects of national environmental policy (intellectual leadership); and the more explicit use of economic incentives and sanctions in pursuit of international environmental objectives (structural leadership) (Young 1991; Lake 1993; Vogel 1997; Tews 2004). Even though hegemony is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the existence of environmental leadership, it is usually only powerful states that have a lasting effect on international negotiations and norm creation. Weaker states may assume a leading position when it comes to developing progressive environmental policies or demanding stringent international rules. But such initiatives will remain ineffective if they are not backed up by political and economic clout that can foster international agreement and induce compliance. For example, smaller European states such as Denmark and the Netherlands have often been in the vanguard of environmental policy innovation, but Germany, Europe's largest economy, is usually credited with providing the essential leadership for advancing environmental policies at the EU level. A similar picture emerges in the international system. It is mainly states that have dominant economic and political clout and whose position in the international economy affords them the possibility of exerting indirect or direct pressure on other states that can provide effective leadership on environmental issues. The United States is a good example of this conclusion. For much of the early phase of international environmental politics, the United States provided international leadership in one form or the other. It was one of the first leading industrialized nations to develop comprehensive environmental legislation and regulatory institutions. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was set up in 1970 to integrate the widely scattered programs and institutions dealing with environmental matters, instantly became a model for similar regulatory agencies that were created in other industrialized countries during the 1970s. Much of this state activity was underpinned by the world's most dynamic environmental movement, which came into existence in the mid-1960s. US environmental groups ranging from the more traditional bodies (Sierra Club, National Audubon Society) to modern environmental nongovernmental organizations (Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace) worked to create broadly based domestic support for a more ambitious environmental policy at home and abroad. US scientists and activists came to play a leading role in the global environmental movement that began to emerge in the 1970s (Kraft 2004). At the international level, the United States began to claim the mantle of environmental leader, first at the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 (Hopgood 1998:96), and later in the context of the multilateral efforts to agree on environmental treaties. Having declared eight whale species endangered based on the Endangered Species Act of 1969, the United States took up the issue of whale preservation internationally and initiated a transformation of the international whaling regime to emphasize species protection rather than natural resource usage. US diplomatic pressure and threat of sanctions were instrumental in getting the International Whaling Commission to place a ban on commercial whaling in 1984 (Porter and Brown 1996:77–81; Fletcher 2001). Also in the 1970s, the United States began to support international efforts to take action against ozone layer depletion and in the 1980s became a key advocate of international restrictions on the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. During the negotiations on the Montreal Protocol, the US government provided important leadership and exerted pressure on skeptical states, especially the European producers of ozone-depleting substances, that objected to strong international measures (Benedick 1991). Whereas the ozone negotiations provided the United States with an opportunity to display leadership in a multilateral context, US policy on the conservation of species took on a more unilateral character. More than any other country, the United States has used the threat of sanctions to change other nations' behavior in areas that endanger threatened species. Using import restrictions on products made in an environmentally damaging way, the US government forced foreign fishing fleets to comply with American standards of protection of, for example, dolphins and sea turtles (DeSombre 2001)."
"NATO leaders meet in Madrid next week on June 29 – 30. Among other things, they are pledged to agree on a new Strategic Concept, replacing the one that has broadly guided the Alliance since 2010. The Strategic Concept is not the Alliance’s only guiding document, but it does set the tone and direction for many years to come and is referred to almost daily as NATO’s 30 nations struggle to forge consensus. It is important to get it right. Maybe the confrontation with Russia will make this too difficult or premature and leaders will defer the new Concept until 2023 — but all Allies recognize that the 2010 language on Russia is wildly out of date. And so too is the language on deterrence. The Alliance is facing an unstable period of cold war-style dynamics and potential nuclear brinkmanship. Strong defense will be essential. The next Concept will rightly reflect moves already underway towards increased defense expenditure, greater national resilience, and increased consultation and Alliance cohesion. This will include forward deployment of forces and enhanced operational activity along NATO/Russia borders But while strong defense is necessary for deterrence, it does not guarantee it. For effective collective defense in unstable times, the 2022 Strategic Concept must deliver modern deterrence fit for the next decade."
"A second critique of neoliberal orthodoxy demonstrates through empirical evidence that trade liberalization has exacerbated global inequality by increasing the income gap between the world’s poorest and wealthiest denizens.64 Trade liberalization has had a particularly devastating impact on small farmers in the global South. According to studies conducted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and various non-governmental organizations, agricultural trade liberalization has benefited large export-oriented agricultural enterprises at the expense of small farmers, exacerbated rural poverty and unemployment, and accelerated migration from rural areas.65 In addition, the export-oriented economic strategy favored by neoclassical trade theory has imposed serious environmental costs on the South, including the erosion of agrobiodiversity, greater pesticide-related illness, agrochemical contamination of groundwater and surface waters, depletion of local aquifers, deforestation, and soil degradation.66"
"Focus on Chinese Anti-Surface Warfare¶ This brief focuses on one area in which China has made rapid and substantial relative improvements: its ability to locate and attack U.S. surface ships, especially aircraft carriers, in conflicts centered on Taiwan or the Spratly Islands.¶ During the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996, China was reportedly unable to locate, much less attack, two U.S. aircraft-carrier battle groups in the waters around Taiwan. In contrast, China can now hold the U.S. Navy's surface fleet at risk at significant ranges from the mainland. This threat to the U.S. surface fleet continues to grow. China's anti-surface capability is founded on four developments: (1) the establishment of an increasingly capable long-range maritime surveillance capability designed to detect and track surface ships, (2) the deployment of sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and the world's first anti-ship ballistic missile, (3) the acquisition of strike aircraft with greater range and power, and (4) the deployment of new classes of larger and quieter submarines armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes.¶   While the development of China's anti-ship ballistic missile capability has garnered headlines, this analysis suggests that the PLA's steady (but less heralded) development of quieter, more capable submarines represents a more immediate threat — one that puts U.S. carrier-strike groups within 2,000 km of the Chinese coast at significant risk. In 1996, China had taken delivery of only two submarines that could be described, by any reasonable definition, as modern. The remainder of its fleet consisted of legacy boats based on 1950s technology, lacking teardrop shaped hulls and armed only with torpedoes. By 2017, China will have a smaller but more capable fleet, with 49 modern ships, including both Russian Kilo-class boats and indigenous designs. China's recent submarine classes are armed with both sophisticated cruise missiles and torpedoes, greatly increasing the range from which they can attack. Although most Chinese boats are diesel-powered and none is not up to U.S. standards, they could nevertheless threaten U.S. surface ships.¶ Assessing the Submarine Threat in the Taiwan and Spratly Islands Scenarios¶ The researchers assessed various aspects of Chinese intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and the anti-surface warfare battle. This discussion is limited to the modeling of Chinese submarine attacks against U.S. carriers in two scenarios at varying distances from the mainland: a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and a campaign to occupy a portion of the Spratly Islands. Inputs included sensor ranges, weapon capabilities, the movement speed of Chinese submarines and U.S. warships, and the ability of U.S. anti-submarine warfare assets (including submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and helicopters) to screen the fleet and to detect and suppress or destroy Chinese submarines.¶ The primary output metric was ""attack opportunities"" — the number of times Chinese submarines could reach positions to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier over a seven-day period. In assessing each scenario, the team considered cases in which each submarine acted individually with no external sources of information about the location of U.S. carriers and cases in which the submarines received cueing about the target location once every 24 hours. The results are not intended to represent fully developed or precise predictions. But given the consistency of the methodology applied over the period considered, they provide a good indicator of trends over time, as well as an idea of the general scale of the challenge at any given point in time.¶ As shown in the figure, under all scenarios and circumstances considered, Chinese capabilities to generate submarine-attack opportunities increased by more than an order of magnitude between 1996 and 2010 — and further increases are likely through 2017. This improvement came despite a reduction in the overall size of China's submarine force and improvements to U.S. anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The quieting of Chinese submarines and the addition of cruise missiles largely accounts for the change.¶ A second notable pattern is that even occasional cueing from other ISR assets regarding the location of U.S. carrier-strike groups would increase the ability of Chinese submarines to engage U.S. aircraft carriers by nearly an order of magnitude above that without cueing. While it is not possible to confidently assess how often cueing might be provided in an actual conflict, improvements to Chinese ISR have improved the chances that Chinese submarines will receive such information. Chinese submarine commanders may not execute an attack every time they have an opportunity to engage, and each attack may not result in a ""hit,"" much less the disabling or destruction of a carrier. However, the modeling indicates that the risks to U.S. carriers are substantial and rising.¶ U.S. Mitigation Options¶ The U.S. military has a variety of means to mitigate specific threats, and it will improve them over time. New counterspace and cyber capabilities may enable U.S. forces to degrade China's space-based ISR, as well as its over-the-horizon radar. The U.S. Navy is almost certainly working on technical counters to China's budding anti-ship ballistic-missile threat, both through kinetic ballistic-missile defenses and, perhaps more importantly, ways to defeat Chinese weapons sensors. Aircraft carriers can provide their own defensive combat air patrols to defeat the threat from enemy aircraft, and the United States is acquiring more and better anti-submarine warfare assets.¶ Nevertheless, given growing threats from China's submarines, as well as China's increasingly capable strike aircraft and anti-ship missiles, U.S. carriers may be held farther from the Chinese coast, particularly during the early stages of a conflict. This will reduce the number of U.S. naval aircraft in the fight, as these aircraft will have to traverse greater distances and will therefore spend less time on station. It will also increase the demand for U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft to refuel them. Increased tanker demand will, in turn, place further stress on available U.S. basing, which may itself be under threat from ballistic and cruise missile attack."
"The ""Crypto Wars"" are here again, which means federal officials are doing all they can to limit the technological tools that keep our personal data secure. President Obama and leaders from the National Security Agency (NSA), FBI, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been pressuring the technology community to build ""backdoors"" that allow government access to encrypted data. The War on Terror provides plenty of rhetorical ammunition to these anti-encryption officials, who seem to believe that purposefully sabotaging our strongest defenses against ""cyberterrorists"" is an effective way to promote national security. But they are dangerously wrong, as recent revelations of decades-old security vulnerabilities imposed by encryption restrictions make all too clear. Encryption allows people to securely send data that can only be accessed by verified parties. Mathematical techniques convert the content of a message into a scrambled jumble, called a ciphertext, which looks like nonsense in electronic transit until it is decoded by the intended recipient. Simple ciphers have been used to secure communications since the days of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, when a particularly devoted scribe took to fancying up the tomb of Khnumhotep II with cryptic funeral prose. Our own Thomas Jefferson regularly used ciphers in communications with James Madison, John Adams, and James Monroe to ""keep matters merely personal to ourselves."" State military and research offices were the main 20th century beneficiaries of advanced encryption techniques until the development of public-key cryptography in the 1970s, which afforded commercial and private users a means to protect their data against unwanted infiltration. Now, what was once a mere means to share secrets has become an indispensable component of personal and national data security. An estimated 40 million cyberattacks occurred in 2014, imposing millions in costs and weeks of frustration for organizations and individual users alike. Many of these costly breaches could be prevented through encryption techniques that regulate data access, authenticate users, and secure sensitive information. A secret report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council—ironically, leaked by Edward Snowden thanks to the government’s own poor authentication practices—even made the case that encryption was the ""best defense"" to protect private data. Yet intelligence agencies and their allies have consistently set out to limit encryption technologies (many of which they developed or relied upon themselves previously). The seeds of the first Crypto Wars were sown during the Cold War, when the U.S. imposed strong export controls on encryption techniques to keep them away from the Ruskies. Only a small set of relatively weak techniques approved by the Commerce and State Departments could be used in international business. But this practice was dangerously self-defeating. Compelling foreign users to settle for weakened encryption standards ultimately made U.S. users more vulnerable by introducing unnecessary fragility."
"The ""fiscal drain"" of illegal immigrants on American taxpayers is about 6 times the price of deporting them, according to a new study that bolsters the Trump administration's bid to remove criminal illegals and cut overall immigration costs."
"The normativism, cultural imperialism and ethnocentrism of some environmental organizations and animal rights activists capture the Makah whalers in essentialized images of culture and tradition and puts pressure on them to conform to the formers’ worldviews and standards. The image of the ‘ecological Indian’, a culture hero created to a large extent by the environmentalist movement, seems to have been replaced once more by an image of the not so noble savage. The criticism directed against the whale hunt became focused on the authenticity of the Makah’s way of reinventing tradition: ‘Notions and essentialized theories on traditional Indian-ness became markers of authority; the non-Indian was deciding and valuing what it was to be an Indian.’57 Apparently, the Makah had to authenticate themselves as ‘genuine’ Makah. In the American case, popular culture is replete with representations of what a ‘real Indian’ is and what ‘authentic’ behavior should be (Erikson 1999:575). Alx Dark, who has studied the Makah whaling conflict in detail, states that the comments of opponents of the hunt ‘have frequently drawn from general, romantic and neo-colonial ideologies about Native Americans’. He adds: ‘This ideological framework allows whaling opponents to dismiss any Makah claim of cultural continuity by citing evidence of cultural change. : : : whaling opponents have at times suggested that Makah cultural aspirations are   “inauthentic”, usually in the process of telling the Makah what their culture was, is or ought to be.’58 Dark further remarks: ‘[T]he Makah are told their modernity “proves” they are no longer “authentically” Makah.’ He takes the stance that ‘the Makah have a right to perpetuate their culture, adapting it to meet new needs. The Makah should not have to choose between putting their culture under glass, or abandoning it entirely in order to participate in American society and the world economy.’59 But any contemporary culture is forged or manufactured to the extent that actors play with a reservoir of available sets of cultural repertoires, deriving meaning from the selected elements. To achieve this end, they can select from a contingent and open field of symbols, objects, and experiences (Miller 1994:321-322). In the sense that any culture, identity or tradition is constructed, reconstructed, invented or reinvented, it is impossible to argue that there is such a thing as an ‘authentic’ culture, identity or tradition (Turney 1999:424) – at least if we take authenticity to mean genuine, original, pure, uncorrupted, pristine, untouched, real, true (Handler 1986:2). Such a mistaken perception sees authenticity as fixed essence, persistent over time. Here we enter the domain of identity politics and the politics of representation. Environmentalists see cultural heritage as something static, as a ‘snapshot’ version of culture at some point in time not as a dynamic force with multiple meanings. This ‘strategic projection of non-Indian stereotypes regarding indigenous lifeways’ went along with ‘deeply ethnocentric visions of what qualifies as authentic culture’ (Sepez-Aradanas and Tweedie 1999:48). Makah whalers regard some traditions worth pursuing or revitalizing as part of an articulated bricolage that is important in identity formation. Doshi argues that ‘the Makah framed their whale hunt as an integral part of their culture – implying, then, that tribal culture is something static that must be recovered and restored for the psychic health of the community’ (2002:95). To some extent, there is indeed an element of essentializing the cultural aspect by the Makah. However, she misses the point that it is an element of their culture that the Makah wish to articulate in their identity politics. It is a ‘strategic essentialism’ (Gaard 2001:17) in the political struggle for self-determination in a postcolonial context. Moreover, the Makah have always adapted and accommodated their culture to economic and political change. For instance, after contact with Europeans, the Makah traded their whale and seal products with them and incorporated new materials such as metal in their harpoons (Dougherty 2001).They even provided the oil to lubricate the machinery in industrializing west coast America. More to the point is Greta Gaard’s criticism that ‘the whale hunting practices of a certain elite group of men have been conflated with the practices and substituted for the identity of an entire culture’ (Gaard 2001:17). Indeed, archeological evidence would seem to indicate that whaling was the preserve of ‘big men’ seeking prestige behavior.60 But appropriation and articulation of this particular aspect of Makah history and culture would seem to have provided the tribe with a charter for cultural resurrection or even cultural survival."
"The connections between a Newtonian paradigm of knowledge, anthropocentrism, and state-centricity may not appear immediately obvious to many. It would, however, characterize a dominant theme in the Western understanding of reality, or what can be described as a modernist worldview. The similarities underline how powerful the influence of worldviews are in shaping deep-seated assumptions about the nature of reality and the ways we ought to ‘know’ the world, which often or commonly posit the existence of atomistic units (or entities) before relations. The importance of such atomistic ontology valuing ‘what-stands-on-itsown’ when it comes to Western worldviews has been discussed elsewhere (Malette 2012; Matthews 2006)."

Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species. Mexico is also considered the second most diverse country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species. Approximately 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislation.

"[*1309] The exclusion of the House is particularly problematic when set in comparative context. As noted, the United States, Mexico, and Tajikistan are the only countries in the world that provide for significantly less involvement by a part of the legislature in treaty making than in domestic lawmaking (by excluding the House in the United States) and make the results of this process automatically part of domestic law in more than a few confined areas of law. This gives rise to the possibility that Presidents could game the system, using the international lawmaking process as an end-run around the House. 215"
"The other reason to believe California will be able to exploit available legal opportunities is logistical. Legal revolutions are not built on ideas alone. They also require an infrastructure—and a set of institutional actors with the will and capacity to advance novel legal claims and make them stick. The most significant development here is the dramatic rise in recent decades of state attorneys general —and their steady acquisition of resources and topflight legal talent. Notable as well is California’s recent high-profile retention of former Attorney General Eric Holder to quarterback the state’s strategizing on federalism matters.13 Even local governments have built impressive litigation shops and staffed them with some of the best and brightest young lawyers. During yesteryear, San Francisco might have buckled in response to Trump administration threats to cut off federal funding if the city does not assist federal immigration authorities. So might have nearby Santa Clara County.  Today, both have sued the Trump administration on the issue and, so far at least, are winning.14"
"In the Israeli, German, and Indian cases, a much more attractive military solution was eventually discovered. Although we can never be certain, it appears that had the Germans, the Indians, and the Israelis not discovered the blitzkrieg, they would have launched limited offensives. Surely the risks would have been considerable (especially in the German case), but given the pressure in each in-stance to take some military action, war probably could not have been avoided. Although a limited aims strategy is hardly ever an attractive option, it is usually not so unattractive that deterrence obtains in a crisis. Finally, there are the cases in which, despite the pressure to find an acceptable military plan, none is forthcoming. In essence, if the attacker chooses to go to war, he is likely either to lose or to find himself engaged in a lengthy war of attrition. Given such circumstances, deterrence is almost certain to hold, as it did for the Allies at Munich and again during the months immediately preceding and following the start of the Second World War. The Allies, however, did formally declare war against Germany, although it seems clear that they would never have attacked Germany had Germany not at-tacked first. Their decision to declare war highlights the intensity of the pressure to take military action against Germany. After their humiliating defeat in 1967, the Egyptians soon carne to believe that some. form of military action against Israel would be necessary. The Egyptians, however, were deterred from starting a conventional war because they feared that they would be defeated. They therefore turned to the war of attrition.28 Conventional deterrence obtained in the Middle East between 1967 and 1973, although this state of affairs certainly did not constitute peace. Throughout the period the Egyptians were preparing themselves to fight against Israel. By late 1972, they had reached the point where they could seriously consider engaging the Israelis in a conventional war. Rec-ognizing that such a course of action entailed serious risks, the Egyptians nevertheless struck in October 1973. Their behavior clearly shows that when a nation is dissatisfied with the status quo, the long-term prospects for deterrence are not promising. The pressure to find an acceptable military solution will be too intense. [211 ] Conclusion THE NATO BALANCE From our analysis of the conventional balance in Central Europe, we may conclude that the prospects for conventional deterrence in some future crisis are quite good. The conventional wisdom not-withstanding, assessment of the balance of forces and the capabilities of each side makes plain that the Pact could not presently expect to score a quick and decisive victory against NATO. Moreover, the on-going proliferation of PGMs appears likely to enhance NATO's position in the immediate future. Although these weapons are clearly not ""super weapons"" that will render the tank extinct, they make it more difficult for the Soviets to effect a blitzkrieg and thus can only increase the likelihood of deterrence. NATO policy makers have good reason, however, to be very cautious when assessing their position in some future crisis. For the cases examined here show that, when a nation has a powerful motive for war, it will go to great lengths to find a suitable military strat-egy. Military planners will be subjected to unremitting pressure. Furthermore, a defender who becomes complacent is likely to be surprised, as were the Israelis in 1973 and the Allies in May 1940. The central message for status quo powers is clear: beware in a crisis, because your opponent is seeking a way to defeat you."
"Forget the allegations of a costly encounter between the Secret Service and Colombian hookers. It was US diplomacy that paid the steepest price at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena. While much of the media coverage narrowed in on allegations that a dozen of the president's men had to be sent home for carousing with prostitutes prior to the arrival of US President Barack Obama, the real action took place once he got there. Obama got an across-the-spectrum earful for the United States' insistence that Cuba can't attend the hemispheric meetings until it makes major democratic reforms. The meetings ended with a thud Sunday, lacking a final declaration or statement of consensus, because so many regional leaders said they won't go to the next Americas summit — in Panama in 2015 — unless Cuba can be there too. That the usual ""yanqui"" bashers like Bolivia's Evo Morales would criticize Washington's Cuba policy was hardly a surprise. Far more significant was the degree to which key American allies, like Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Colombian leader Juan Manuel Santos, the summit's host, were willing to go to bat for Havana. Never mind that Latin America has gone through a period of blistering economic growth in recent years, thanks in large part to Washington-backed trade policies. Or that US commerce with the region has surged 46 percent since 2009, as Obama told fellow leaders. It was the US trade embargo against Cuba — not trade — that they wanted to talk about. From left to right, Latin leaders backed Cuba with a unanimity that was unimaginable during the Cold War, or even as recently as a few years ago, when the US could count on conservative governments in the region to support its Cuba policies. This time, only Canada's Stephen Harper sided with Washington in opposing Havana's presence at the gatherings, hosted by the Organization of American States (OAS), which kicked out Cuba in 1961. Obama sought to deflect the criticism by suggesting that Cuba and the octogenarian Castros were old news and not pertinent to the region's real problems. “Sometimes those controversies date back to before I was born,"" said the US president, born two years after Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution swept the island. But with the American trade embargo against the island still very much alive after 50 years, Latin leaders are tired of having to choose sides between Washington and Havana and hear their constituents complain of American bullying. “Isolation, embargo, indifference and looking the other way have shown their inefficiency,"" Santos said Saturday in his remarks to open the summit, to hearty applause. “It is an anachronism that keeps us anchored in a Cold War era.” Santos, a moderate who nevertheless traveled to Havana last month to meet with Cuban President Raul Castro about the island's exclusion from the summit, said future gatherings without Cuba would be “unacceptable.”"
"Overall, concerns about drug use are high. Over half of all Americans say their concern about drug use has increased over the past five years (53%). Only 3 percent say their concern has decreased, while 44 percent say their concern has stayed the same. Concerns are increasing the most in minority and low-income communities."
"This week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided seven Mississippi food processing plants and arrested 680 workers for immigration violations. The moral cost of these raids to our shared humanity is apparent in stories like that of a tearful 13-year-old boy waving goodbye to his mother or an 11-year old girl pleading for her father’s release. But some people might feel differently, believing such scenes are just the cost of enforcing our immigration laws. If that’s you, I urge you to weigh another cost instead: the sheer financial expense of such cruelty. First, there’s lost income. ICE was created in 2003 to “protect national security and public safety after 9/11,” but this week’s raids were not about security or safety or terrorism. They targeted immigrants while they worked to support their families and our economy. Many of the arrested individuals now leave behind jobs that won’t be filled and children and spouses who now live without a family member and their associated income. Their communities and local businesses will suffer down the line. And state and local governments will lose the associated tax revenues; undocumented workers pay an estimated $12 billion a year in taxes. Then there are the costs of enforcement and detention. ICE Acting Director Matt Albence admitted that the raids required a yearlong investigation and 600 agents to execute. The 680 arrested individuals now languish in detention facilities. According to ICE, the average daily cost of detaining one person is $134. Some estimates place the cost at closer to $200 per day. Given this administration’s immigration policies, from family separation to zero tolerance to mass raids, the number of immigrants in detention is rapidly expanding, not retracting. For every person who leaves detention, another replaces them, if not two. Even using ICE’s conservative figure of $134, the cost of keeping one immigrant in detention is almost $50,000 per year. The detention expense alone for the group detained on Wednesday is approximately $100,000 a day, $3 million per month, and $36 million a year. Given that more raids are coming, these costs are only going to go up. There is yet another cost: Raids add to the immigration court backlog. According to Syracuse University, the number of cases pending in immigration courts is close to 1 million and ballooning by the day. Under the Trump administration, this number has nearly doubled in just 2½ years, and the average wait for an immigration hearing is now more than two years. Detention centers holding people awaiting their time in immigration court have exceeded their capacity, which necessitates the use of private prisons, whose owners made record campaign donations in the past election cycle. Last year alone, taxpayers paid almost $1 billion to the private prison complex for immigration detention. Meanwhile, private prisons have minimal oversight and harsh conditions that resemble slave labor. The result is an increasing number of immigrants caught up in the detention system, a larger immigration court backlog, a financial incentive to keep immigrants in detention longer, and correspondingly higher cost to taxpayers. The truth is that no government has unlimited resources. When choosing how to spend public funds, we need to weigh costs and benefits. This administration has decided to spend countless time and money arresting nonviolent workers who take care of their families and their communities while spending little or nothing on combating domestic terrorism and white nationalism. CNN reported this week that the Department of Homeland Security sought to increase its focus on domestic terrorism but was rebuffed by the White House. Meanwhile, two gunmen killed 31 people in Dayton and El Paso last weekend — yet another cost of this administration’s immigration policies. ICE officials are boasting that the workplace raids in Mississippi were the largest in over a decade. That is nothing to brag about. Beyond the countless families and lives torn apart in these operations and mass arrests, the time and financial resources necessary to execute them are wasteful and unnecessary. These raids are merely a show to fire up an anti-immigrant base — and a costly show at that."
"How does FMF work? Most FMF-funded purchases are made through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) framework. A few countries have received exceptions to use FMF funds for Direct Commercial Sales. Foreign Military Financing funds are budgeted three years in advance, as part of the regular State Department budget cycle. For FY2011, the total funding for the FMF program was $5.37 billion. The FY2012 estimate was $6.31 billion. (Source – pdf file; see p. 171) How does an FMF-financed sale work? For the most part, an FMF-financed sale works just like other sales under the Foreign Military Sales process. The main difference is that funding comes from the FMF program rather than the foreign government customer. (A sale may be fully funded through FMF, or may be partially FMF-funded and partially paid by the foreign customer.) This has the benefit of helping allied countries buy military equipment they otherwise might not be able to afford, creating additional sales opportunities for U.S. defense companies. For U.S. defense companies, ensuring that Foreign Military Financing funds are available and budgeted to a particular sale will probably require additional coordination during the pre-LOR stage of the FMS process. We’ll discuss the pre-LOR process in more detail in a separate post. FMF vs. FMS Clients often ask me about the difference between Foreign Military Financing and Foreign Military Sales. In reality, FMF and FMS aren’t directly comparable. FMF provides funding for defense purchases, while FMS is the program for managing the sale and transfer of military items. Sales funded by FMF are almost always processed through the FMS program. (Only a few countries have exceptions to use FMF funds for Direct Commercial Sales.) The FMS program, on the other hand, may be used for FMF-financed sales, or for sales paid for by the foreign customer."
"What is striking about the empirical patterns we will present in the ensuing pages is not that immigration matters. What is striking is just how broad the effects are. We already know that many white Americans have felt threatened by different minority groups across American history (Tichenor 2002, Olzak 1992). What is impressive is just how wide ranging those effects remain today and how the presence of different minority groups can heighten or diminish those effects. In a political era, in which many claim that the significance of race has faded, we find that Latino or immigrant related views impact the political orientation of many members of the white population. Party identification – the most influential variable in American politics – is at least in part a function of the way individual white Americans see Latinos and immigrants. So too is the vote in national contests for President and Congress. In short, who we are politically at our core is shaped substantially by deeply felt concerns about immigration and racial change."
"U.S. Shipbuilding Industrial Base The status of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base, particularly the part that builds military ships for the U.S. government, has been a concern in Congress and elsewhere since the early 1990s, following the end of the Cold War, when the rate of Navy shipbuilding declined substantially. Concern has focused on, among other things, whether the total amount of work being received by shipyards is sufficient to maintain their financial health and to preserve key design and construction skills. 30 Other things held equal, construction of one or more new polar icebreakers for the Coast Guard could increase workloads at the yard or yards involved in their construction for a period of a few or several years."
"What Clive Hamilton airily dismisses as a ‘growth fetish’ has resulted in one hour of work today delivering twenty-five times more value than it did in 1850. This has freed huge chunks of our time for leisure, art, sport, learning, and other ‘soul-enriching’ pursuits. Despite all the exaggerated talk of an ‘imbalance’ between work and family life, the average Australian today spends a much greater proportion of his or her lifetime free of work than they would had they belonged to any previous generation in history.  There is another sense, too, in which capitalism has freed individuals so they can pursue worthwhile lives, and that lies in its record of undermining tyrannies and dictatorships. As examples like Pinochet’s Chile and Putin’s Russia vividly demonstrate, a free economy does not guarantee a democratic polity or a society governed by the rule of law. But as Milton Friedman once pointed out, these latter conditions are never found in the absence of a free economy.(12) Historically, it was capitalism that delivered humanity from the ‘soul-destroying’ weight of feudalism. Later, it freed millions from the dead hand of totalitarian socialism. While capitalism may not be a sufficient condition of human freedom, it is almost certainly a necessary one.  [continues] Wherever populations have a chance to move, the flow is always towards capitalism, not away from it. The authorities never had a problem keeping West Germans out of East Germany, South Koreans out of North Korea, or Taiwanese out of Communist China. The attraction of living in a capitalist society is not just that the economy works. It is also that if your version of the good life leads you to turn your back on capitalism, you don’t have to pick up sticks and move away. If you don’t like capitalism, there is no need to bribe people-smugglers to get you out of the country. You simply buy a plot of land, build your mud-brick house, and drop out (or, like Clive, you set up your own think tank and sell books urging others to drop out)."
"China and Russia, Frenemies Sharing one giant, resource-rich landmass, China and Russia are in many ways natural enemies. But for now they have more reasons to team up against the U.S. instead, and it’s not clear the U.S. is ready to deal with it. The China-U.S. rivalry is more glaring these days, mainly because President Donald Trump keeps aggravating it. Today he took credit for holding up a trade deal, and yesterday he threatened massive tariffs on Chinese goods if Xi Jinping doesn’t meet with him at the G-20 summit. He’s personally friendlier toward Russia – which helped get him elected, after all – but his administration has not been. James Stavridis points out China and Russia share an interest in spreading authoritarianism around the world, and they currently have matching needs; China needs Russia’s raw materials, while Russia needs China’s influence. As Russia encourages disunity in Europe, China tries to pull Europe-adjacent countries into its orbit with its “One Belt, One Road” scheme. Can the center hold? Trump’s Pentagon, meanwhile, has ditched its longstanding goal of being able to fight two wars at once, in order to focus on fighting one very big war, against either China or Russia. Right away you see the problem, writes Hal Brands: What if China and Russia both want to fight at the same time? And what if a third combatant – North Korea, say – jumps into the fray? Perceived U.S. weakness, Hal writes, could make every rival bolder, and the world more dangerous."
"In the era of Industry 4.0, data flows will become an even more important production factor. But hacker attacks are increasing worldwide and causing ever greater damage. Countermeasures are necessary and must be harmonized at international level. The United States remains the most important player in global cybersecurity. Hacker Attacks Are Causing Ever Greater Damage Owing to global interconnectedness, information-technology attacks do not know national borders. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of attacks registered in Germany have increased eightfold. Further we observe a wide range of threats and challenges. Most recently, hackers hijacked everyday objects like webcams or routers and carried out denial-of-service attacks (DDos). According to Symantec’s Security Threat Report 2018, connected devices are increasingly the target of cyberattacks – with an increase of 600 per cent within a single year. Industrial enterprises are often victims of targeted, scheduled and more complex attacks. Hacker seek prolonged access to the IT infrastructure of a company in order to steal, manipulate or destroy data longitudinally. In doing so, they can cause huge damage. In the case of large companies, the repair of an attack costs an average €800,000. Defence Strategies Must Be Coordinated at the International Level Security in the digitally interconnected world is only possible through cooperation. Effective protection from cyberattacks demands countermeasures that are developed in an international context. Under Germany’s Presidency of the G20 in 2017, cybersecurity was on the agenda for the first time. Moreover, industry takes a stand on the issue within the Business 20 (B20) process as well. The German B20 Presidency urged the G20 to improve cyber risk management by encouraging: the development of a harmonized cybersecurity baseline framework, the development of a concept for a global interoperable information-sharing platform under OECD guidanc, and a process leading to norms for responsible state behavior. Because the level of protection is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, we need worldwide open markets for cybersecurity products and services. Therefore, bilateral and international trade agreements must harmonize international security requirements and standards. With regard to law enforcement, mutual legal assistance treaties are necessary to enforce law in digital space in a timely manner. Moreover, common international standards should be developed for state access to communication and information structures. Furthermore, bilateral statements of intent on outlawing industrial espionage should be rapidly drafted and specified. The United States and the EU Are Important Actors on the International Stage In the digital economy, the United States is the No. 1 global player. The world’s most innovative and competitive IT companies are U.S. based. The United States have thus particular responsibility for cybersecurity policy. Together with the United States, Germany and the EU must make a commitment in bilateral and multilateral agreements to establish a reliable cybersecurity regime. Undermining NATO would send the wrong signal."
"One empirical mapping connects feminist inflected activism to the transformation of social policy in the 1970s and beyond. It traces how women came to influence policy in order to expand benefits for women (as independent citizens) and to promote improved provision for children. The following is an extract from an interview with a social policy academic: We developed a critique of the male breadwinner model out of our own family experience. We used our professional skills to send evidence off to policy makers, working on issues of taxation, pensions, child benefit, family law, domestic violence and so on. In the 1970s there was a concern to improve the lot of women; and in some ways it was as if we were pushing at an open door. It got harder in the 1980s, it was quite hard to get a handle on Thatcher - the paradigm had shifted, the door had slammed and we had far fewer networks with policymakers. The Y B a Wife campaign and Rights of Women emerged out of the original financial and legal independence campaign, and the Women’s Budget group is a continuation of these in some respects. I therefore saw this [involvement in the WBG] as enabling me to do the things I had done in the 1970s again. I worked on issues of childcare and social care, maternity provision, work life balance etc. The WBG always comments on pre-budget reports and writes submissions to the Treasury on their impact on women. There were some ministers and civil servants who were happy to use our arguments but you trained them up and then they moved on to another policy area. We had some successes: the value of gender impact statements was finally accepted by the last New Labour government 9 However, the label comes off as soon as it gets into government – it’s very hard to trace a specific policy back to its origins. You just sow these little seeds and hope that something grows from them. There are several points that can be drawn from this account: the extent of feminist networks that connected campaigners, academics and policy actors; the breadth and variety of the feminist agenda; patterns of change over time; and the ambivalence of the outcomes. This work can be viewed as complicit with the turn towards a ‘social investment state’ that constituted women as full worker citizens, and enabled capitalist and state enterprises to access cheaper, more flexible, less unionised workforce, as well as investing in the capacity of future generations to take their part as productive worker citizens in the global economy (Lister, 2004). The selective incorporation of gender agendas here can be viewed as a triumph of neo-liberal forms of appropriation of feminist politics (though as noted earlier, some feminist scholars have argued that it represented something ‘after’ neoliberalism). In the same period concerns about parenting, family stability and care became amplified. These projects addressed women as citizen-subjects in different ways, the first calling on women to participate in the economy as full adult worker citizens; the second interpellating them as carers, parents and responsible citizens. One might, then, depict feminism as functional to neoliberalism in two different, and contradictory ways. In the first, the expanded role of female labour – more flexible, less unionised and more suited to the service economy – can be viewed as constitutive of a new economic order of flexible accumulation. In the second, women are viewed as integral to advanced neoliberal strategies of governing the social, sustaining the domestic economy that reproduces the conditions of capital accumulation. However such functionalist readings offer limited purchase on the contradictions at stake in the regendering of the economy and society. In each case neoliberal projects were themselves transformed - in part - through their encounters with feminist and other activist claims. Employers came to bear the ‘costs’ of equality governance, parental leave and more complex patterns of work demanded by women’s entry as full worker citizens. Welfare states, while looking to curb benefits paid to ‘dependent’ women, had to invest in development, empowerment and training and to launch a multiplicity of ‘social’ programmes in order to enable women both to contribute to the economy and to manage care work."
"Punt. The White House says it won't negotiate but also doesn't want a politically created financial crisis to derail Mr. Obama's second-term agenda. Some Senate Democrats, particularly those facing re-election in 2014, decide they need something to show for a vote to raise the debt ceiling, which could be used in campaign ads against them. They propose midsize deficit reductions, via spending cuts and tax changes, that reduce the deficit by roughly $500 billion over 10 years. Mr. Boehner persuades many rank-and-file House Republicans not to risk taking a stand that could lead to a stock-market plunge, worried that a negative reaction could harm them at the ballot in 2014. They offer their own proposed budget changes but avoid politically charged issues like the health law. Negotiations go down to the wire—both sides must look like they are holding out for the best possible deal—but the House proposal is similar enough to the Senate plan that Democrats and Republicans hash out a compromise that raises the debt ceiling $500 billion or so. Then they revisit the whole issue again sometime in 2014 or 2015. Chance of this happening: 65%"
"Event Summary What role did education play in the 2014 midterm elections, and what’s next for education policymakers wishing to implement reform at the state and federal levels? Two days after the GOP’s victory, AEI’s education department hosted a panel discussion addressing how states will take the lead on education, and feel emboldened to do so, post-2014. AEI’s Rick Hess began by noting the evolving role of the states and federal government, predicting that the US Department of Education will now face considerable difficulty in convincing states to buy into President Obama’s waiver-heavy approach. Education Week’s Alyson Klein agreed that the Common Core and teacher evaluation reforms have been marked with the “Obama stamp,” although this could change in the future. Jeanne Allen of the Center for Education Reform continued by claiming that the elections will give Americans with reasonable objections to the Common Core the opportunity to voice their concerns. Democrats for Education Reform’s Charles Barone then turned to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), predicting an ESEA reauthorization in the new Congress, while Bethany Little of the Education Counsel noted that such legislative action will be impossible if leaders come to the table with only their party’s agenda in mind. Looking ahead, Hess predicted that education policy could play a greater role in 2016 than it did in 2014 if the issues register more for voters than matters such as foreign policy. On issues such as prekindergarten, he expressed how Republicans have a critical opportunity to speak to the concerns of American families and what’s best for their children. –Elizabeth English Event Description The 2014 midterm elections are quickly approaching, with big implications for K–12 schools and higher education institutions around the country. More than 40 states are currently rolling out the Common Core State Standards, teacher tenure lawsuits have been filed in California and New York, and the Obama administration recently announced a $250 million grant program to create and expand prekindergarten initiatives. In the postsecondary education realm, Democrats and Republicans alike have introduced bills to reform college repayment plans. During a time of politicized education debates ranging from curriculum and standards to early-childhood education, what will the midterm election results mean for state and federal education policies? Two days after the elections, we welcome you to join us at AEI for a balanced discussion of state education initiatives, federal spending, and what the future may hold for policymakers wishing to implement education reform at the state and federal levels."
"The look that the native turns on the settler's town is a look of lust, a look of envy; it expresses his dreams of possessionöall manner of possession: to sit at the settler's table, to sleep in the settler's bed, with his wife if possible. The colonized man is an envious man. And this the settler knows very well; when their glances meet he ascertains bitterly, always on the defensive `They want to take our place'. It is true, for there is no native who does not dream at least once a day of setting himself up in the settler's place'' ([1961] 1967, page 30). Numerous authors have theorised about the intersection of possession, sexuality, urbanism and race (for example Low, 1996). The machinic geography of phenotype, however, takes issue with the Hegelian self/other scheme that supports much of this work, and studies instead how certain bodies stick to certain spaces, how they are chained by hunger, cold, darkness, mud, poverty, crime, glances full of envy and anxiety. The segregation between colonists and colonised is the apparently binary result of many nitty-gritty material processes which, when analysed, render it a lot less binary. This also means race is devious in inventing new ways of chaining bodies. Race is creative, constantly morphing, now disguised as sexual desire, now as la mission civilatrice, all the while weaving new elements in its wake. Deleuze and Guattari might say that what defines race is not rigidity or inevitability, but its ``lines of flight''. Race can be as stark as apartheid, but mostly it is fuzzy and operates through something else. The social sciences literature on race (urban geography, postcolonial theory, film studies) remains relevant from the machinic perspective. Race is shown to exist through ghettoes, travel writing, and Hollywood cinema. What this literature shows is precisely race's plastic, emergent, and more-than-human spatiality (for example, Anderson, 1991; hooks, 1992; Jackson and Penrose, 1993; Jacobs, 1996; Robinson, 1996). Still, more geographical and anthropological work needs to be done to theorise the biocultural imbrications of race. For example, in the introduction to the collection Race, Nature and the Politics of Difference it is argued that ––both race and nature are historical artefacts: assemblages of material, discourse, and practice irreducible to a single timeless essence. By charting the ways in which race and nature work together, and by tracing key disruptions in their busy traffic, we emphasize the cultural labors required to maintain them as they are. ... We write against racismsönot against `race' but against the exclusionary effects pro- duced through its invocation, deployment, and reproduction'' (Moore et al, 2003, page 42). But the full implications of the term assemblageöthat it includes biological and other nonhuman forcesöstill need to be explored. There is some work being done that quietly disrespects the disciplinary boundaries of modern epistemology. Anthropolog- ically inclined medical research has the potential to offer a critical approach to the biocultural aspects of racial division (Wade, 2002, pages 117 ^ 122). Luca Cavalli-Sforza maps human migration using genetics and physical anthropology as well as archae- ology, linguistics, and history (Cavalli-Sforza et al, 1994). This research deserves theoretical attention, so that more rigorous studies of the discursive, technological, and economic embeddedness of phenotype can be imagined. Zack (2002) has recently argued that physical anthropology can only account for variation through heredity, not the folk (taxonomic) conception of race as such. She therefore continues to define `race' as an essentialist social construction which has no basis in the science of phenotype. What is needed, however, is to highjack the folk conception and rethink race as culturally embedded phenotype. Saying that race has no basis in biology is different from saying that phenotype plays some role in racial differentiation. Pheno- type is a crucial element in the assemblage called race, and, because phenotype is already nondiscrete and shaped by culture, race cannot be an essentialist concept. Now, what does this nonessentialism mean to antiracist politics?"
"My chapter, though, did not look for specifc studies which could support one specifc argument (e.g. ‘democracy is a good thing’ or ‘democracy has instrumental value as it brings peace between states’). The aim of the chapter was to investigate the question whether democracy leads to interstate war or peace, by analysing dozens of statistical studies which have been selected in a systematic way. The analyses revealed many caveats."
"One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated."
"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — A new analysis of military training conducted off Virginia finds that nearly all of the Outer Continental Shelf in that area is incompatible with offshore drilling now being pushed by members of Congress and the Trump administration."
"However, it is important to mention that the Chinese impact on the economic and trade relations of nafta, considering the region as a whole, have been exaggerated. In reality, it can be argued that the impact of China has been limited. From figure 5, we can see that China is an important partner of the three countries, with shares of 14%, 7.6% and 9.2% in the United States, Canada and Mexico markets, respectively. On the other hand, the members of nafta still represent the largest share of trade with each other. In the case of the United States, its two nafta partners had a combined share of 29% of the market; for Canada, 65.9% and for Mexico 69.2%. When comparing the Chinese export shares in each of the three countries that make up nafta, it is clear that they are still much lower than the export shares within the region."
"But mostly diseases don't drive species extinct. There are several reasons for that. For one, the most dangerous diseases are those that spread from one individual to another. If the disease is highly lethal, then the population drops, and it becomes less likely that individuals will contact each other during the infectious phase. Highly contagious diseases tend to burn themselves out that way.¶ Probably the main reason is variation. Within the host and the pathogen population there will be a wide range of variants. Some hosts may be naturally resistant. Some pathogens will be less virulent. And either alone or in combination, you end up with infected individuals who survive.¶ We see this in HIV, for example. There is a small fraction of humans who are naturally resistant or altogether immune to HIV, either because of their CCR5 allele or their MHC Class I type. And there are a handful of people who were infected with defective versions of HIV that didn't progress to disease. ¶ We can see indications of this sort of thing happening in the past, because our genomes contain many instances of pathogen resistance genes that have spread through the whole population. Those all started off as rare mutations that conferred a strong selection advantage to the carriers,"
"Today, President Donald Trump will reportedly issue an executive order to begin construction of a wall along the U.S-Mexico border. The long-awaited move follows through on one of Trump’s most visible campaign promises.¶ It’s also a big mistake. Not only would a wall be outrageously expensive — estimates range as high as $14 billion (and no, Mexico won’t pay for it) — but a wall is misguided because it addresses the exact wrong problem. The biggest immigration crisis facing the country has nothing to do with Mexicans illegally crossing the border. Instead, it’s that hundreds of thousands of Central Americans are fleeing brutal violence and extreme poverty in their home countries and seeking asylum in the United States — but our immigration system is overwhelmed and completely unprepared to handle the flood.¶ I know this issue firsthand. Over the past two decades, I have served in senior homeland security positions in both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations — first as policy director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the years after the 9/11 attacks, and most recently as assistant secretary of homeland security for border, immigration and trade policy in the Obama administration. During those years, I have seen an extraordinary transformation not only of our border, but also in our deepening relationship with Mexico.¶ It’s true that in the 1990s, the border was out of control, with illegal entries approaching 2 million a year. But since then, we’ve dramatically strengthened enforcement by tripling the size of the Border Patrol, deploying drones and, yes, constructing hundreds of miles of fence along the border. It’s now hard to cross, and the economics of human smuggling show this: It now costs 12 times more in real dollars to hire a “coyote” than 15 years ago. That’s dramatic bipartisan progress in securing our border, although you wouldn’t have known it from last year’s presidential campaign.¶ More importantly, Mexico has changed. Over the past two decades, it has grown into the world’s 11th largest economy, deeply integrated with ours through cross-border infrastructure and supply chains, all facilitated by binational efforts to reduce barriers to commerce at the border. As a result, there are good jobs for Mexicans in Mexico — and, thus, more reasons for Mexicans to stay. This was certainly true during our economic crisis of 2008-09, but it remains true today.¶ In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, more Mexicans now leave the U.S. than head north, and border apprehensions are down a whopping 75 percent since 2000. Simply put, fewer people are coming, and our border authorities catch and remove most who try.¶ This is not to say there isn’t a crisis, however. There is one, but it’s different from the one Trump thinks exists. It doesn’t involve Mexican migrants, and a wall won’t solve it. The actual crisis involves thousands of migrants from Central America’s “Northern Triangle” — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — who are fleeing brutal gang violence, extreme poverty or malnutrition. Roughly half of these migrants are women and young children escaping desperate circumstances, facing the real possibility of death or rape if they stay. Others are fleeing extreme poverty in remote regions where education ends at the sixth grade and families are limited to one meal a day.¶ America obviously cannot solve all the economic problems of Central America, but under U.S. and international law, all migrants are afforded the opportunity to apply for asylum protection if they make it to U.S. soil. If U.S. immigration officials make an initial determination that the migrants have a “credible fear” of harm back home, they are referred to U.S. immigration courts for a full hearing on their asylum claim. Unaccompanied children who reach the U.S. are quickly either placed in foster care or with U.S.-based relatives while their asylum claims are heard in court. Given the dangerous conditions in Central America, nearly half of these asylum claims ultimately succeed."
"Forensic Science Defined? Forensic science is a combination of broad scientific fields and is used to answer questions revolving around crime scenes and legal matters. Forensic science may be applied to a felony or a civil action. However used, the field of forensic science will apply various technologies and formulas to expedite an investigation. As a result of advancements in computer technologies and the evolution of scientific fields, forensic science is regarded as an integral aspect for crime scene investigation. Forensic science, regardless of the specific field, is used to evaluate crime scenes in hopes of extracting evidence that will ultimately lead to a conviction. Forensic science, because of the agglomerated framework, is often described as a broad discipline within the science and law enforcement community. Within forensic science exists a number of specific disciplines, which may range from forensic veterinary science to forensic anthropology."
"Critiques of the CRC come in three general forms. First, some simply call the CRC ineffective because it has no enforcement teeth. They claim the CRC is simply ineffective to stop the world’s most horrifying abuses of children, such as child trafficking for sexual exploitation, compulsory child labor, child soldiering and forcible child marriage, because it has no enforcement mechanisms adequate to end them.66 While they are correct to say these atrocities violate the rights of children as set out in the CRC, the conclusion that their continued occurrence is evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Convention is simply wrong. Examples include the laws I’ve already referred to. Critics also claim the CRC would undermine U.S. sovereignty. They contend that the CRC violates our American principle of federalism. Finally, they call the CRC anti-family and say it will reduce parental control over children in favor of government control. I’ll address each of these in turn. First, child trafficking and soldiering are largely perpetuated by criminals and outlaws, not governments that are parties to the Convention. Likewise, harmful cultural practices are carried out by families and religious groups, not formally by governments. The CRC is focused on government obligations. Second, the Convention is the first step, never meant to be the last, in addressing these problems. The CRC is not a criminal enforcement statute; rather, by establishing positive legal rights for children to be protected from abusive and harmful treatment, it provides an important legal framework that legislators and reformers can and should use, and have used, to advocate for domestic legislation, policies, and practices that enforce those rights within their own countries. As I previously indicated, many CRC critics fear that our U.S. ratification would undermine United States sovereignty and the principle of federalism. These concerns are neither new nor completely invalid. However, it is critical to note that the U.S. has adequately addressed them in the other human rights treaties it has ratified for over half a century through the use of Reservations. Reservations are an international treaty tool that allows countries to harmonize treaties with their domestic law and to leave all domestic implementation of treaty provisions to their legislatures.67"
"School choice-on the other hand-is slated for increased funding that would not serve Native students well. Specifically, the proposed FY 2018 budget includes funding for Secretary DeVos and President Trump's ideas regarding school choice, including $1 billion for a proposal that NIEA opposes to make funding for Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ""portable."" The effect of this proposal would be to divert money from schools that serve the largest proportions of students from low-income households. NIEA opposes this policy and will instead be advocating for full funding for Title I."
